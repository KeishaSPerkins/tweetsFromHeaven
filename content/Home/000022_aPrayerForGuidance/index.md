description = "Everyone feels lost sometimes. Glory to God for giving us His Word and His Spirit to guide us day by day. Doubt and uncertainty can creep in to make us fearful of the decisions we must make. Trouble and trial are some of life's guarantees. But fear not! Your God has conquered the world (John 16:33)! Call out to Him and He will tell you things you never knew (Jeremiah 33:3)! What verses help you when you feel lost?"
