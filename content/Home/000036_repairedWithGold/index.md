## Kintsugi

Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup>

**What a moving portrait of the way the Lord cares for us!**

### He remakes us...
<div class='bible-text'>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: “Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.

Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the Lord. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel.
<p class='bible-reference'>Jeremiah 18:3-6 NIV</p>
</div>

### So we can love our scars...
<div class='bible-text'>and He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
<p class='bible-reference'>2 Corinthians 12:9-10 NKJV</p>
</div>

### And see beauty in place of ruin.
<div class='bible-text'>for those who grieve in Zion...a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair...
<p class='bible-reference'>Isaiah 61:3 NIV</p>
</div>

So what will we say to these cracked and broken hearts? Will we bury our pieces or let the potter put us together again?

Let the Lord mend your brokenness so that you can shine in His light!
