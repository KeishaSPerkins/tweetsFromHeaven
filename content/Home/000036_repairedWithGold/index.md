description = "When I first heard of kintsugi, I was immediately reminded of God's love for us. How He carefully collects our broken pieces, putting them back together and filling any cracks. What joy to serve a God who brings us joy from trial (James 1:2-4), strengthening us even as we stumble (Job 4:4)."
