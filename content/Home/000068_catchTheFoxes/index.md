<div class='bible-text'>Catch all the foxes, those little foxes, before they ruin the vineyard of love, for the grapevines are blossoming!
<p class='bible-reference'>Song of Solomon 2:15 NLT</p>
</div>

Here, the vineyard is the budding relationship between the couple in the poem. The foxes represent issues that tear relationships apart. What lesson can we glean from fox behavior so that me way protect our relationships?

## Possessiveness
Foxes mark their territory with unpleasant scents and droppings so that other animals know they own the place. 

In any relationship, it is not one person who owns the other like a toy or trinket—so possessiveness has no place. Resist the urge to mark and defend a person like property. Instead, trust their decision to be in relationship with you.

## Bitterness and Grudges
Foxes raid waste and compost bins and dig up flowerbeds, making a mess and spoiling a garden.

Bitterness has no place in a loving relationship. Instead of burying conflict only to dig it up after it smells, deal with your frustrations and get rid of grudges.

## Passive Aggression ("False" Alarms)
Foxes make screaming calls that can sound like a person in distress when there is no actual danger.

When we are hurting in relationship, it's important to address the issue at hand and not mask what we're actually upset about. Don't sound the wrong alarm; make what you are feeling plain.

## Collateral Damage
Foxes can eat small pets like cats or rabbits, and make your yard unsafe for them.

Those around us do not deserve to suffer because there is a breakdown in a relationship. So when we see others feeling the effects of our brokenness, we must take steps to set it right.

## Resentment
Foxes make dens under houses and sheds, and having them around means you can expect all of the previously listed issues.

Instead of letting our unspoken issues take up residence in our relationship, drive them out. Don't let resentment find a place in your relationships—because it will destroy your garden.

Do you have a fox in your relationships? Start taking steps to root them out today.
