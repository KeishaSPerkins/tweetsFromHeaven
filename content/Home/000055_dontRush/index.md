It's so easy to rush through life, eager to turn the next corner. Or to look back and wonder why it took so long to know what you know now. 

But the Bible tells us that God is strategic and purposeful about time. Let's see what wisdom the Bible has for us concerning timing.

<div class='bible-text'>There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven—
<p class='bible-reference'>Ecclesiastes 3:1 NASB</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity, but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 21:5 NLT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>He answered, “The Father is the one who sets the fixed dates and the times of their fulfillment. You are not permitted to know the timing of all that he has prepared by his own authority.
<p class='bible-reference'>Acts 1:7 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Enthusiasm without knowledge is no good; haste makes mistakes.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 19:2 NLT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end.
<p class='bible-reference'>Ecclesiastes 3:11 NASB</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Refuse to worry about tomorrow, but deal with each challenge that comes your way, one day at a time. Tomorrow will take care of itself.
<p class='bible-reference'>Matthew 6:34 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>So, dear friends, don’t let this one thing escape your notice: a single day counts like a thousand years to the Lord Yahweh, and a thousand years counts as one day.
<p class='bible-reference'>2 Peter 3:8 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Wealth from get-rich-quick schemes quickly disappears; wealth from hard work grows over time.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 13:11 NLT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a person may be weighed down by misery.
<p class='bible-reference'>Ecclesiastes 8:6 NIV</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Do you see someone who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for them.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 29:20 NIV</p>
</div>

When we rush, we stumble. 

But when we work diligently and patiently, we succeed in due time.
