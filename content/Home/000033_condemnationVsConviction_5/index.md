description = "In my experience, the easiest way to tell condemnation from conviction has been the direction it makes me want to run. If it turns me away from God, I know it is from the evil one. What ways have you spotted condemnation's pull in your life?"

Yesterday, we saw how conviction gives us appetites for justice while condemnation ultimately pulls us to do wrong.
Let's continue examining godly sorrow and how it contrasts with the sorrow of the world.

## Conviction shows you how God sees you.

We all sin and come short. God does not hide that fact, but when God views us, He does so in the light of Christ's sacrifice. So that though we are flawed, we are made righteous through the Son. 

## Condemnation is the enemy's view of you.

The enemy calls us irredeemable and worthless. He highlights our mistakes as evidence in the hope that we give in and agree with him.

## Conviction drives you to God.

Conviction exposes a flaw in order to drive us to the only one who can help us overcome it. We run toward God, seeking the changes that He Himself makes to our hearts.

## Condemnation drives you away from God.

Condemnation exposes a shortcoming in order to drive us away from the very one helping us. We run away from God, trying to heal ourselves for fear of the wrath we've been told will surely come. 

God sees you as His adopted heir,holy in His sight.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup>
 He stands with arms flung wide, ready to pull you close<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-b-reference' href='#footnote-b'>b</a></sup>
and replace your fear with love!<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-c-reference' href='#footnote-c'>c</a></sup>
Do not let the enemy's lies<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-d-reference' href='#footnote-d'>d</a></sup> tell you otherwise.
