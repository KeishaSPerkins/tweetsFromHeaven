title = " Bible Study Tools: Concordance"
weight = 0
description = "There are so many tools that help us study the Bible more thoroughly. My favorite study tool is a good concordance. Looking up a topic and seeing all the ways the Word speaks to it is always great. It's also so good to be able to see how the Bible authors used repeated words to lend meaning. Try using a concordance in your study. You won't regret it!"
