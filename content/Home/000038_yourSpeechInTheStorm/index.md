When we are in crisis, our emotions can come to overtake us, and we speak rashly. 

But even as you walk through chaos, it's important to _**T.H.I.N.K.**_ before you speak.

## T: Is it True?
<div class='bible-text'>Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.
<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:15 NIV</p>
</div>

## H: Is it Helpful?
<div class='bible-text'>Don’t use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.
<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:29 NLT</p>
</div>

## I: Is it Inspiring? 
<div class='bible-text'>Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 16:24 NIV</p>
</div>

## N: Is it Necessary? 
<div class='bible-text'>Too much talk leads to sin. Be sensible and keep your mouth shut.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 10:19 NLT</p>
</div>

## K: Is it Kind? 
<div class='bible-text'>But instead be kind and affectionate toward one another. Has God graciously forgiven you? Then graciously forgive one another in the depths of Christ’s love.
<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:32 NLT</p>
</div>
