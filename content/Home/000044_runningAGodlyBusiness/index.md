Running a business can be very stressful, but glory to God for taking the weight. He has given us wisdom for navigating deals and dilemnas! Let's look at some of the advice the Bible gives us about business.

## Remember That it is Really God's Business

It can be easy to think that the businesses we run are ours alone. But the truth is that we are stewarding all that we have. We must keep God at the forefront of everything we do, because it his God who gives us the power to do it. 

And if we lose sight of this truth, and begin to boast and become puffed up about the successes of our businesses, we may find that success turned around. After all, pride come before the fall!

<div class='bible-text'>Remember the Lord your God. He is the one who gives you power to be successful, in order to fulfill the covenant he confirmed to your ancestors with an oath. 
<p class='bible-reference'>Deuteronomy 8:18 NLT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Your boast becomes a prophecy of a future failure. The higher you lift up yourself in pride, the harder you’ll fall in disgrace.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 16:18 TPT</p>
</div>

## Always Seek Direction from God

It's tempting to try to figure out things in our own power, to work hard to find our own way. But the Spirit gives us direction and warnings to lead us to victory and away from ruin. Not consulting the Lord for your business is refusing to use the best tool at your disposal!

Because we are only human--having limited knowledge and understanding--we can't possibly know better which way to turn than God's Spirit. But the beautiful news is that we have access to the Spirit who prompts us (in real time) about the things we need to do.

<div class='bible-text'>Trust in the Lord completely,
and do not rely on your own opinions. With all your heart rely on him to guide you,
and he will lead you in every decision you make.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 3:5 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Your own ears will hear him Right behind you a voice will say, “This is the way you should go,” whether to the right or to the left.
<p class='bible-reference'>Isaiah 30:21 NLT</p>
</div>

It is when we trust God fully that we are able to let our businesses be guided by his omnipotent will.

## Prioritize Integrity Over Money.

Seeking justice over profit is a distinguishing characteristic of a Godly business. When we can do what it right even if it is not the best for the bottom line, we treat people the way Jesus did. 

Society often paints the picture that in order to succeed in business, we must take shortcuts, cut corners, and misuse people. But the Lord honors truth and justice. He causes us to succeed when love our neighbors.

<div class='bible-text'>The Lord detests the use of dishonest scales, but he delights in accurate weights.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 11:1 NLT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>A beautiful reputation is more to be desired than great riches, and to be esteemed by others is more honorable than to own immense investments.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 22:1 TPT</p>
</div>

## Resist the Urge to Strive

Trust God's instruction, timing, and provision. We saw earlier how the Lord tells us when to turn and in which direction. He takes care to guide us if we listen to His voice. So when we are faced with how make our business work, the key is to just do what the Lord is telling us. 

This also means that we mustn't just work all day, trying to force things to go the way we would like. Any one of us can surely put in enough hours, toiling at our craft until _something_ happens. But that is not the way the Lord designed us to live!

<div class='bible-text'>It really is senseless to work so hard from early morning till late at night, toiling to make a living for fear of not having enough. God can provide for his lovers even while they sleep!
<p class='bible-reference'>Psalm 127:2 TPT</p>
</div>

Instead, He can provide for us even as we rest in His goodness! And we can rest indeed, because He has more than enough to provide for us. After all, He is the creator of the entire universe! Surely He has enough to provide for you!

<div class='bible-text'>Yes, God is more than ready to overwhelm you with every form of grace, so that you will have more than enough of everything—every moment and in every way. He will make you overflow with abundance in every good thing you do.
<p class='bible-reference'>II Corinthians 9:8 TPT</p>
</div>

So resist the urge to struggle and strive for yourself. He's must better at providing for us than we are for ourselves.

## Seek to Improve the World Around You

Our businesses are not just for us. They allow us to help the people around us who need it. When God moves in the world, He often _partners with_ humans to make change. So if you have an opportunity to help those around you, jump at it! God will reward you.

<div class='bible-text'>It is better to invite those who never get an invitation. Invite the poor to your banquet, along with the outcast, the handicapped, and the blind—those who could never repay you the favor. Then you will experience a great blessing in this life, and at the resurrection of the godly you will receive a full reward. 
<p class='bible-reference'>Luke 14:13-14 TPT </p>
</div>

## Find Counselors and Advisors

No man (or business) is an island. It is important to seek out people of integrity who can guide us. Ask God to bring the people who will help you, so that they can share their experience with you and enrich your business. It's silly to think that only you know what's best. When you have a solid group of advisors, you can attack a problem from many sides!

<div class='bible-text'>People lose their way without wise leadership,but a nation succeeds and stands in victory when it has many good counselors to guide it.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 11:14 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>A fool is in love with his own opinion, but wisdom means being teachable.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 12:15 TPT</p>
</div>
