description = "Sometimes it can feel hard to feel valuable. In this culture, most people only value what you do or don't do. But God calls us valuable, even though we could never repay Him. His inescapable love for us makes us valuable. When the enemy rushes in, trying to overtake your mind, remember that you are the apple of God's eye. He will never forget about you. He will never leave you behind. He will always say &quot;You are enough.&quot;"
