description = "When I read this account of the journey to Emmaus, I remember times when I was blinded like the men of the story. Either by circumstance, expectation, or stubbornness, there have been many times when I've just not seen God right in front of me! Thank God for divine revelation and renewed understanding! What were some of your blind times? What helped you to see?"
