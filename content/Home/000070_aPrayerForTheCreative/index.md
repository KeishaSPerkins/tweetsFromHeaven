Sometimes as creatives, we can get caught up in the works of our hands—blinded by the likes and shares and affirmation.

But let's take a moment to say what God says about human creativity.

Lord, I thank You for the complexity of my mind. For it is through You that I am able to create.
<br>Psalm 139:14, Acts 17:28

As I create, I am always listening for Your voice to guide me. For I am Your masterpiece—designed to bring beauty into the world.
<br>Proverbs 3:6, Ephesians 2:10

Because I am made in Your likeness, my creativity is powerful to bring about change. I accept my responsibility to cultivate good with my creative endeavors.
<br>Genesis 1:27-28

Help me to create not for man, but for Your kingdom. For I know that service to You bears a lasting reward.
Amen
<br>Colossians 3:23-25, Matthew 6:33
