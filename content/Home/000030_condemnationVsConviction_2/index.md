If what you are feeling is not bringing you to repentance and ultimately toward victory, it is not of God! Resist condemnation from the enemy today! He and his lies will surely flee!"

Last time, we looked at an illustration of godly sorrow and how it affects our lives. Let's start contrasting conviction from God with condemnation from the enemy.

## True Conviction Leads to True Repentance
Godly sorrow brings about a change of heart. It might make you a little sad, but that sadness quickly gives way to a renewed way of thinking.

## Condemnation Just Leads to Legalism
Condemnation causes forced behavioral change and rigid rule-following. It makes you feel remorse, but doesn't renew your mind.

## Conviction is For Your Gain
Conviction urges you toward improvement. It points out a path to victory right from where you are.

## Condemnation is Always For Your Loss
Condemnation tells you that you are not--and never will be--good enough for God, so you should just give up.

All of this is points back to one simple truth: God is for you, but Satan is against you.

God sets us up to win!<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup> He fights on our behalf<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-b-reference' href='#footnote-b'>b</a></sup> to guarantee victory because His ultimate goal is that we are all saved. <sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-c-reference' href='#footnote-c'>c</a></sup> But Satan attempts to steal from us, because his ultimate goal is our death and destruction. <sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-d-reference' href='#footnote-d'>d</a></sup>

Have you felt condemnation's pull to strive for unreasonably perfect behavior, only to be left with feelings of guilt and inadequacy?

How did you overcome it? Comment below!
