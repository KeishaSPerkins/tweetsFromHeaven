description = "As we continue this series on knowing condemnation from conviction, remember that God is for you. He would not send a correction that would cause you misery. If what you are feeling is not bringing you to repentance and ultimately toward victory, it is not of God! Resist condemnation from the enemy today! He and his lies will surely flee!"
