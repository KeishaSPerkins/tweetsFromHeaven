<div class='bible-text'>But don’t let the passion of your emotions lead you to sin! Don’t let anger control you or _be fuel for revenge,_ not for even a day.
Don’t give the slanderous accuser, the Devil, an opportunity to manipulate you!
<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:26-27 TPT
</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Do you want to be a mighty warrior?
It’s better to be known as one who is patient and slow to anger.
Do you want to conquer a city?
Rule over your temper before you attempt to rule a city.

<div class='bible-text'>Can you bridle your tongue when your heart is under pressure? That’s how you show that you are wise.
An understanding heart keeps you cool, calm, and collected, no matter what you’re facing.
When even a fool bites his tongue he’s considered wise. So shut your mouth when you are provoked—
it will make you look smart.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 17:27-28 TPT</p>

<div class='bible-text'>Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. 
Human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires.
<p class='bible-reference'>James 1:19-20 NLT</p>

<div class='bible-text'>When your heart overflows with understanding
you’ll be very slow to get angry.
But if you have a quick temper,
your impatience will be quickly seen by all.
