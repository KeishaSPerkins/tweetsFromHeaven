When we are in crisis it can be hard to keep our focus in a healthy place. If we let our thoughts run wild, our fear can overwhelm us.
But the Bible lets us know where our focus should lie.

## Focus on Jesus

<div class='bible-text'>We look away from the natural realm and we fasten our gaze onto Jesus who birthed faith within us and who leads us forward into faithâ€™s perfection.
<p class='bible-reference'>Hebrews 12:2 TPT</p>
</div>

Try reading the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and see how Jesus behaves, how He interacts with people and the things He says. Ask God for new understanding of His character through scripture.

## Focus on God's Promises

<div class='bible-text'>God is not a man, so he does not lie. He is not human, so he does not change his mind. Has he ever spoken and failed to act? Has he ever promised and not carried it through?
<p class='bible-reference'>Numbers 23:19 NLT</p>
</div>

Try searching "Bible promises for [area you need encouragement in]" select a few verses and practice speaking them aloud when you feel upset.

## Focus on Praising God

<div class='bible-text'>Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Everyone thank God, for he is good and easy to please. Your tender love for us, Lord, continues on forever.
<p class='bible-reference'>Psalm 106:1 TPT</p>
</div>

Try a worship playlist on your favorite music streaming service. It's a great way to discover new songs to sing to the Lord.

## Focus on God's Presence
<div class='bible-text'>When we live our lives within the shadow of God Most High, our secret hiding place, we will always be shielded from harm. How then could evil prevail against us or disease infect us?
<p class='bible-reference'>Psalm 91:9-10 TPT</p>
</div>

Pray and invite God into your daily doings. Converse with Him as you would a friend you're spending your day with. He is always listening.
