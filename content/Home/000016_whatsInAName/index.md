## Identities Under Attack
Sometimes, our identities are called into question or even outright attacked. We'll look to "The Three Hebrew Boys" to find an example of what it looks like to withstand an attack on who we are.

The story of the Three Hebrew Boys may be familiar to you. These three young men were thrown into a large furnace as punishment for refusing to worship a statue of the king. <sup><a class="footnote-reference" id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup> The story ends with them coming out the furnace unburned, but what we're focusing on today is detailed two chapters before, in Daniel chapter 1.

The Bible tells us that Israel had just lost a war to Babylon and that many people of the noble families in Israel had been taken away to serve in the palace there. <sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-b-reference' href='#footnote-b'>b</a></sup> Let's read starting at the third verse:

<div class="bible-text">
  <sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief of staff, to bring to the palace some of the young men of Judah’s royal family and other noble families, who had been brought to Babylon as captives. <sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>“Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. “Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon.
  <p class="bible-reference">Daniel 1:3-4 NLT</p>

</div>

So here we see a specific order to take the high-status members of Israelite society and put them in a lowered position. We'll meet a few of these high-status Israelites in the next verses.

<div class="bible-text">
  <sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were four of the young men chosen, all from the tribe of Judah.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>The chief of staff renamed them with these Babylonian names: Daniel was called Belteshazzar. Hananiah was called Shadrach. Mishael was called Meshach. Azariah was called
  Abednego.
  <p class="bible-reference">Daniel 1:6-7 NLT</p>
</div>

Here we see those familiar names: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. But what we're seeing here is that these young men's names have been changed. So let's take a look at what these Hebrew names meant, as well as what the Babylonian names meant.

Daniel translates to "God is my judge." Hananiah translates to "Jehovah is gracious." Mishael translates to "Who is what God is?" Azariah translates to "Yahweh has helped."

Belteshazzar translates to "May Bel protect his life." Shadrach translates to "Servant of Aku." Meshach translates to "Who is what Aku is?" Abednego translates to "Command of Nego."

Now we see what's really happening with this name-change. Not only are these young men being brought very far from home, but they are made servants in the Babylonian palace and given new names that exalt false gods. This is made worse because we know that people in ancient Israel and Babylon people would have been very aware of name meanings. They would have
put a great deal of thought into naming a person. I believe this was a strategic attempt to take away their Jewish identities and give them Babylonian lives.

## How Does this Apply to Me?
Each and every one of us has been given a call by God. He has given us a name that speaks to our purpose, telling us who we are and who we are to be. But there are forces around us that would like that name changed. Perhaps it's the culture around us, the people around us, or even the fear within us--whatever the reason, you may find who you are under attack.

But there is good news: the only name we need pay attention to is the name given to us by the Father. When He formed us in the womb, He knew well what He had planned for us. He has destined each of us for something, and no one can take that
destiny away.

So maybe God has called you a teacher, but those around you say that you aren't fit to teach. Maybe He has called you to go into your community help the people around you, but you are discouraged because your efforts seem to make little difference. Perhaps He's called you to a specific location, but your family thinks it would be foolish to go there. I don't know what your call is, but I bet you do. Today is the day to start answering to your God-given name!

**Let's Pray**: Father, thank You for the identity You have given us. You call us children of the Most High God. You say that we are Your own. And because You are our Father, we have access to Your throne of grace. We know You have called us for a purpose. Give us endurance to keep answering to the name You have given us. And when we are unsure of that call, make Your voice clear in our ears. Open our ears, hearts, and minds to hear what You are speaking to us. Give us your strength that propels us from our weakness. And as we walk in Your purpose, let everyone everywhere know that we are
Yours. Amen.
