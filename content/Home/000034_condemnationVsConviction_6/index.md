This week, we examined the differences between conviction and condemnation
When trying to discern conviction from condemnation, try asking yourself these questions...

1. Am I truly repenting of this sin? Or am I just trying to follow a rule?
1. Is this thought designed to help me win? Or is telling me to give up?
1. Is this making me want to try again after I've fallen? Or is it making me want to wallow in guilt and regret?
1. Does this thought give me renewed zeal? Or is it sapping me dry?
1. Is this changing my appetites? Or is it telling me I'll always struggle with this?
1. Does it make me want to stand up or sit down in the face of injustice?
1. Does this view my flaws through the filter of Christ's blood or through the lens of the enemy?
1. Does it make me want to run to God or flee from His presence?

Remember: condemnation leaves you trapped in a cycle of negativity. Conviction stops the cycle and gives you a new path. If the sorrow you feel is just making you feel terrible, and not producing any improvements in you, it is not of God.

May God raise your discernment so that you are never trapped in condemnation again, for there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup>
