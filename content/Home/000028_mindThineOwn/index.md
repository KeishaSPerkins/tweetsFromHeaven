The Bible is full of practical advice for life. 

Let’s look at what it says about meddling in other people’s affairs.

<div class='bible-text'>It’s better to grab a mad dog by its ears than to meddle and interfere in a quarrel that’s none of your business.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 26:17 TPT</p>
</div>
<div class='bible-text'>Aspire to lead a calm and peaceful life as you mind your own business and earn your living, just as we’ve taught you.
<p class='bible-reference'> 1 Thessalonians 4:11 TPT</p>
</div>
<div class='bible-text'>Fire goes out without wood, and quarrels disappear when gossip stops. A quarrelsome person starts fights as easily as hot embers light charcoal or fire lights wood.
<p class='bible-reference'> Proverbs 26:20-21 NLT</p>
</div>
<div class='bible-text'>Avoiding a fight is a mark of honor; only fools insist on quarreling.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 20:3 NLT</p>
</div>
<div class='bible-text'>How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.
<p class='bible-reference'>Luke 6:42 ESV</p>
</div>
<div class='bible-text'>When arguing with your neighbor, don’t betray another person’s secret. Others may accuse you of gossip, and you will never regain your good reputation.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 25:9-10 NLT</p>
</div>

Minding your own business will never go out of style! Go forth! And remember to stay in your own lane.
