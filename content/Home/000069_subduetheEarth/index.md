## Dominion Given
In the book of Genesis, we see God give humanity dominion over all of creation. He instruct humans to subdue the earth.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup>

Does this mean we can do whatever we want? After all, we've got dominion!<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-b-reference' href='#footnote-b'>b</a></sup>. We are to subdue creation!<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-c-reference' href='#footnote-c'>c</a></sup>

Let's look in the second chapter for some insight:

<div class='bible-text'>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-d-reference' href='#footnote-d'>d</a></sup> it and to keep<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-e-reference' href='#footnote-e'>e</a></sup> it. 
<p class='bible-reference'>Genesis 2:15 KJV</p>
</div>

This certainly challenges the view of dominion and subdual as a human free-for-all. So what should humans be doing instead?

## The Role of Humanity is That of a Gardener in a Garden.
Nature has no problem producing on its own. Free of human influence, fruit trees would still exist.

But under the careful maintenance of a skilled cultivator, a small orchard can produce fruit for a whole town.
It is the same in our lives.

While we may not have an orchard, we've been given authority in various ways. Trusted with spheres of influence.

How are you cultivating the areas of your life you've been given dominion over? How are you tilling the soil entrusted to you?
