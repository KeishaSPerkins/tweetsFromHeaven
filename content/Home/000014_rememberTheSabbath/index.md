description = "When I was a child, I remember a big deal being made about working on Sundays. But I've since come to learn that Sabbath is not about legalistic duty, but about remembering to stop the toil, stop the worry, and simply rest. It can be hard to resist the daily grind, but a pause to get back to the freedom and provision God promises us is never wasted time!"
