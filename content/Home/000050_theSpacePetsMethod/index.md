## What is S.P.A.C.E. P.E.T.S.?
Earlier this week, we talked about the S.O.A.P. Method for Bible study. Today, we'll talk about a method that can go hand-in-hand with it to help us with the "Application" part of the S.O.A.P. Method: S.P.A.C.E. P.E.T.S.

With space pets, you ask yourself if you can find any of these in the text:
- S: Sin to confess
- P: Promise to claim
- A: Attitude to change
- C: Command to obey
- E: Example to follow
- P: Prayer to pray
- E: Error to avoid
- T: Truth to believe
- S: Something to praise God for

When we try to apply the Bible to our lives, it can seem hard because the Bible is an ancient library of books written by and to an ancient people. Some of the cultural context can get in the way of it feeling relatable. During times like these, it can help to ask if we find any of the elements of SPACE PETS in the scripture.

## Let's practice.
What do you see in this passage about the older brother of the famed prodigal son?

<div class='bible-text'>“The older brother was angry and wouldn’t go in. His father came out and begged him, but he replied, ‘All these years I’ve slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to. And in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends. Yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the fattened calf!’
<p class='bible-reference'>Luke 15:28-30 NLT</p>
</div>

### Do you see...
- **Sin to confess:** have you been unforgiving and vengeful?
- **Attitude to change:** is there an issue you refuse to budge on that's hurting those around you?
- **Error to avoid:** are you refusing to celebrate the successes of others?

What others do you see?

## Let's keep practicing.

How about the woman in the parable of the lost coin?

<div class='bible-text'>
“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Won’t she light a lamp and sweep the entire house and search carefully until she finds it? And when she finds it, she will call in her friends and neighbors and say, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost coin.’  In the same way, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels when even one sinner repents.”
<p class='bible-reference'>Luke 15:8-10 NLT</p>
</div>
