Have you noticed that just as you're entering a growth season, you are often slammed with a trial?

## Don't fear! 

It is only a scarecrow! Its purpose is to distract you from the bountiful fields just ahead!

<div class='bible-text'>And a man in the crowd shouted desperately, “Please, Teacher, I beg of you, do something about my boy. He’s my only child. He’s possessed by an evil spirit that makes him scream out in torment and hardly ever leaves him alone.
<p class='bible-reference'>Luke 9:38-39a</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'><strong>As the boy approached,</strong> the demon slammed him to the ground, throwing him into violent convulsions.
<p class='bible-reference'>Luke 9:42a</p>
</div>

## Keep going!

<div class='bible-text'>Jesus sternly commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and immediately it left. Jesus healed the boy of his injuries and returned him to his father, saying, “Here is your son.”
<p class='bible-reference'>Luke 9:42b</p>
</div>

What are your scarecrows? Where are your fields? Don't let the enemy scare you. Go forward and reap your harvest!
