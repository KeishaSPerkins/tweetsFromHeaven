<div class='bible-text'>For everything there is a season,⁣⁣<br>
a time for every activity under heaven.⁣⁣<br>
A time to be born and a time to die.⁣⁣<br>
A time to plant and a time to harvest.⁣⁣<br>
A time to kill and a time to heal.⁣⁣<br>
A time to tear down and a time to build up.⁣⁣<br>
A time to cry and a time to laugh.⁣⁣<br>
A time to grieve and a time to dance.⁣⁣<br>
A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones.⁣⁣<br>
A time to embrace and a time to turn away.⁣⁣<br>
A time to search and a time to quit searching.⁣⁣<br>
A time to keep and a time to throw away.⁣⁣<br>
A time to tear and a time to mend.⁣⁣<br>
A time to be quiet and a time to speak.⁣⁣<br>
A time to love and a time to hate.⁣⁣<br>
A time for war and a time for peace.⁣⁣<br>
