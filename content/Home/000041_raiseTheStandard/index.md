# Have you heard this scripture...

<div class='bible-text'>When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.
<p class='bible-reference'>Isaiah 59:19b KJV</p>
</div>

# But What Does "Standard" Mean Here?

The word "standard" originates from Middle English, and refers to a flag raised on a pole as a rallying point in battle. It is an object that soldiers can look for to find where allies are. 
When we use the phrase "raise a standard" we are talking about rallying for a fight!

## We find a story of how powerful the standard of God can be in Exodus.

<div class='bible-text'>The Isrealites are fighting with a nearby nation. During the battle, and Moses raises the staff the Lord gave him over his head. <strong> As long as he held it high, the Isrealites were winning.</strong> <br><br>
But when the standard fell, so did the Israelites. Eventually, others helped Moses hold the staff high through the night, and Israel secured the victory.
<p class='bible-reference'>Exodus 17:8-16</p>
</div>

The chapter ends with Moses saying, "Hold high the banner of the Lord!"<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup>

When God says He will raise a standard, it is to help you win! You gain victory when you look at Him!

When God says He will raise a standard, it is to help you win! You gain victory when you look at Him! Be sure to hold your banner high! He fights for you!
