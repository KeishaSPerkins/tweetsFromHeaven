Have you ever been feeling down, and reached for the Bible for encouragement, only to feel that it just didn't work? Does this mean that scripture is just not good for encouragement? Or could there be another problem?

<div class='bible-text'>What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways! ... His pleasure and passion is remaining true to the Word of “I Am,” meditating day and night in the true revelation of light. He will be standing firm like a flourishing tree planted by God’s design, deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss, bearing fruit in every season of his life. He is never dry, never fainting, ever blessed, ever prosperous.
<p class='bible-reference'>Psalm 1:1-4 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do.
<p class='bible-reference'>Joshua 1:8 NLT</p>
</div>

Here the word **meditate** refers to a low grumble—like the sound of a lion growling over its meal. We are to continually keep the Word in our hearts and mouths—repeating it, turning it over in our minds. It is then that we receive its treasures.

The Bible is clear that it should be studied as a habit, not mined for encouraging quips. 

So while the Bible is powerful for mending our mental, emotional, and spiritual wounds. It's not to be used as a feel-good button. It is food to be eaten daily. It is not a pain reliever that we reach for only when we're exhausted and in pain. 

Just as a healthy diet is better for our overall health than an aspirin or ibuprofen, daily nourishment from the Word is so much better for us than cherry-picked verses when we're feeling low.

Give it a try.

Begin a regimen of regular study in God's Word. Start as small as you need to. It will do you so much good!
