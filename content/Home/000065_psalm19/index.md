<div class='bible-text'>
The instructions of the Lord are perfect,⁣⁣⁣<br>
reviving the soul.⁣⁣⁣<br>
The decrees of the Lord are trustworthy,⁣⁣⁣<br>
making wise the simple.⁣⁣⁣<br>
The commandments of the Lord are right,⁣⁣⁣<br>
bringing joy to the heart.⁣⁣⁣<br>
The commands of the Lord are clear,⁣⁣⁣<br>
giving insight for living.⁣⁣⁣<br>
Reverence for the Lord is pure,⁣⁣⁣<br>
lasting forever.⁣⁣⁣<br>
The laws of the Lord are true;⁣⁣⁣<br>
each one is fair.⁣⁣⁣<br>
They are more desirable than gold,⁣⁣⁣<br>
even the finest gold.⁣⁣⁣<br>
They are sweeter than honey,⁣⁣⁣<br>
even honey dripping from the comb.⁣⁣⁣<br>
They are a warning to your servant,⁣⁣⁣<br>
a great reward for those who obey them.⁣⁣<br>
