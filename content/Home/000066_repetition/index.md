When we read the Bible, a great tool for understanding is watching out for repetition.

Let's look at just a few examples of how biblical authors can use repetition to cause us to further examine the Scriptures.

## Repetition of Words and phrases
In the creation narrative found in the first chapter of Genesis, we see God call His creations good <sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup> seven times.

This repetition establishes God as the decider of what is good—and by extension what is not good. It also shows us what good means: order instead of chaos, life instead of death.

## Repetition to Contrast Ideas
Later in the third chapter, we see humanity decide for itself what is good<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-b-reference' href='#footnote-b'>b</a></sup>, taking the role that has already been established as belonging to God.

What follows is humanity's downfall: exile from the truly good things of the Garden.

## Repetition of Themes 
In chapter four, we see God implore Cain to “do well<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-c-reference' href='#footnote-c'>c</a></sup>” and avoid sin—giving him the same option his parents faced: to do what God has said is good, or to define good for himself.
We know his choice.

## Repetition of Plot
In chapter 16, after God promises Abram and Sarai a son, their impatience causes them to make the decision that what will be good is to make a baby by their own power. It doesn’t end well.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-d-reference' href='#footnote-d'>d</a></sup>

Fast forward a couple generations, and we see that same bad decision play out with Jacob and Rachel.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-e-reference' href='#footnote-e'>e</a></sup>

## How do we put this to practice for understanding scripture?
The next time you are reading and notice repetition, ask yourself what ideas, themes, and points might be at play.
Don't be afraid to read a single passage several times to see what you notice.

What you find may surprise you.

For instance, the book of Judges may seem like an endorsement of terrible violence and war until you notice that the sentence "In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-f-reference' href='#footnote-f'>f</a></sup>" repeated throughout the book.

There goes that decision about what is good again, and the destruction it brings with it. 

The Bible is constantly repeating itself to emphasize points and implore the reader to mull over the scripture and gain wisdom.

What biblical repetitions come to mind? What repeated words, ideas, themes, and plots do you see when you study?
