<div class='bible-text'>
What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways!<br/>
  <span class="indent">
    He won’t walk in step with the wicked,</br/>
  nor share the sinner’s way,</br/>
  nor be found sitting in the scorner’s seat.
</span></br/>
His passion is to remain true to the Word of “I AM,”
  <span class="indent">
    meditating day and night on the true revelation of light.
  </span></br/>

  He will be standing firm like a flourishing tree<br/>
  <span class="indent">
    planted by God’s design, deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss, bearing fruit in every season of life. He is never dry, never fainting, ever blessed, ever prosperous.
  </span>  
  <p class='bible-reference'>Psalm 1:1-3 TPT</p>
