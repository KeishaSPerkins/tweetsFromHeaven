<p>One of the enemy's favorite tricks is to try to bring  condemnation to God's people.</p>

<p>"Satan" means "accuser" and he never fails  to live up to the title. But not only does he accuse, he lies and says it is coming from God!</p>
<p>Let's look at what Paul called "godly sorrow," a perfect picture of Christian conviction.</p>


<div class='bible-text'>Even if my letter made you sorrowful, I don’t regret  sending it (even though I felt awful for a moment when I heard how it  grieved you). Now I’m over-joyed—not because I made you sad, but because  <mark>your grief led you to a deep repentance</mark>. You experienced godly sorrow, and as God intended, it brought about <mark>gain for you, not loss</mark>,  so that no harm has been done by us. God designed us to feel remorse over sin in order to produce repentance that leads to victory. This  leaves us with <mark>no regrets</mark>. But the sorrow of the world <mark>works death</mark>. Can’t you see the good fruit that has come, as God intended, because of your remorse over sin? Now you are <mark>eager to do what is right!</mark> Look at the indignation you experienced over what happened and how alarmed you became. What holy longing it awakened, what <mark>passion for God</mark>, and how <mark>ready you were to bring justice to the offender</mark>. Your response has proved that you are free of blame in this matter. So I wrote you not simply to correct the one who did the wrong or on the behalf of the one who was wronged, but to help you <mark>realize in God’s sight</mark> how loyal you are to us.
<p class='bible-reference'>2 Corinthians 7:8-12 TPT
