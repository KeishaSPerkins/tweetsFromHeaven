<h1>Let’s set the scene</h1>
<p>Much of Israel is in exile, having been captured and taken to Babylon (Daniel 1:1-2). They are away from their home,
  the land promised to them. They feel sad and hopeless, unable to rejoice the way they once had (Psalm 137:1-4).
</p>
<h1>But the Lord Had Different Ideas</h1>
<p>The Lord sends His prophet, Jeremiah with instructions for the people. We can see two “dos” and two “don’ts”.
</p>
<h2>Do Prosper
</h2>
<div class='bible-text'>"Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce. Marry and have
  children. Then find spouses for them so that you may have many grandchildren. Multiply! Do not dwindle away! And work
  for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, for its welfare will
  determine your welfare."
  <p class='bible-reference'>Jeremiah 29:5-7 NLT</p>
</div>
<p>With exile come grief and discouragement, and it’s tempting to throw in the towel. The Lord tells them to plant
  gardens and have weddings. He wants them to have children and work for the peace and prosperity of the place they are.
  He wants them to multiply, not dwindle away under the pressure of their current circumstance.
</p>
<h2>Don’t be fooled </h2>
<div class='bible-text'>This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: "Do not let your prophets and fortune-tellers who are with you in the land of Babylon trick you. Do not listen to their dreams, because they are telling you lies in my name. I have not sent them,” says the LORD.
<p class='bible-reference'>Jeremiah 29:8-9 NLT</p>
</div>
<p>In a time of turmoil it can be easy to listen to any voice that promises like a solution. God warns the people about false prophets who will rise up to try to trick the people. He warns them not to trust was these fortune-tellers are saying.</p>
<h2>Do seek God and His plan</h2>
<div class='bible-text'>This is what the LORD says: “You will be in Babylon for seventy years. But then I will come and do for you all the good things I have promised, and I will bring you home again. For I know the plans I have for you,” says the LORD. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. In those days when you pray, I will listen. If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me. I will be found by you,” says the LORD. “I will end your captivity and restore your fortunes. I will gather you out of the nations where I sent you and will bring you home again to your own land.”
<p class='bible-reference'>Jeremiah 29:10-14 NLT</p>
</div>
<p>During a trial, it is hard to remember that God is for us, not against us. God tells the Israelites that He has a great plan for them, and even tells them some of it. He promises that if they look for Him, He will reveal himself.</p>
<h2>Don't Be Sorry</h2>
<div class='bible-text'>But this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David’s throne and all those still living here in Jerusalem—your relatives who were not exiled to Babylon. This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says: “I will send war, famine, and disease upon them and make them like bad figs, too rotten to eat. Yes, I will pursue them with war, famine, and disease, and I will scatter them around the world. In every nation where I send them, I will make them an object of damnation, horror, contempt, and mockery. For they refuse to listen to me, though I have spoken to them repeatedly through the prophets I sent. And you who are in exile have not listened either,” says the LORD.
<p class='bible-reference'>Jeremiah 29:16-18 NLT</p>
</div>
<p>Not all of Israel was in exile. There was even a king sitting on Jerusalem’s thrown! Those in exile could easily wonder “why me?” But God tells them of what destruction will come for those false priests while the exiles are safe in Babylon. </p>

Do you feel like you are in exile, stripped of the things you once had? Don’t despair! Instead, plant your gardens and seek only His voice. God is faithful. Your captivity will end.  His plans for you are good.
