<h1>Have You Heard the Parable of the Talents?</h1>
<p>A businessman goes away on a long trip. Before leaving, he gives some of his employees some money to manage until he gets back. One employee gets $5,000. Another get $2000. Another get $1000. </p>
<p>When he comes back, he asks the employees what they did with the money. The first two invested the money and doubled what they had been given. The boss was so pleased, he gave them raises! But the one with the $1000 buried the money; the boss was so disappointed, he fired him immediately.</p>
<h2>Why Did He <em>Bury</em> It?</h2>
<p>He says was afraid, saying that the boss was hard to please and that he was a ruthless man. He told the boss that because he was so afraid, he just hid it away
</p>
<h1>Sound familiar?</h1>
<p>Have you buried the gifts you’ve been given, worried God won’t be pleased with what you do with them? Do you have an image of God as a hard master, ready to reject your efforts? Has your fear of what might happen if you just took the first step made you settle for something safe? Have you surrendered to comfort, not losing, but also not growing?</p>
<h1>Take heart!</h1>
<p>This story can sometimes make us feel guilty about the gifts we’ve buried. We see ourselves in that third employee, and feel we’ll soon be reprimanded for our lack of increase. But we must remember the story has not ended. </p>
<p>Every day you rise is an opportunity to walk in your calling! As you open your eyes each morning, realize that God still has purpose for you. Don’t let fear leave you empty handed when the story ends</p>
<p>Dig up what you buried before he returns.
