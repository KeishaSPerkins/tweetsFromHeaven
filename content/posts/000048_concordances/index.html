description = "There are so many tools that help us study the Bible more thoroughly. My favorite study tool is a good concordance. Looking up a topic and seeing all the ways the Word speaks to it is always great. It's also so good to be able to see how the Bible authors used repeated words to lend meaning. Try using a concordance in your study. You won't regret it!"

<h1> What is a Bible concordance?</h1>
<p>A Bible concordance is an index of words used in the Bible and a reference for where each word occurs within the Bible.</p>

<p>There are many free online concordances, and you can also buy them in print.</p>

<h1> Why would I use a concordance?</h1>
<p>Concordances are useful for finding passages. Only remember one word from a passage you want to find? Looking for passages that refer to the same topics and concepts as the one you're reading? A concordance can help with that!</p>

<h1> How do I use a concordance?</h1>

<p>Let's say you know there's a verse that talks about harvests, but you can't quite remember where it is or exactly how it’s worded. Looking up the entry for “harvest” may lead you to something that looks like this:</p>

<table style="background:#f7f4ec; max-width:500px; margin: 2rem auto; border-spacing: 5px;border-collapse: separate;width:100%;font-family:serif; box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.5);">
<tbody>
  <tr>
  <td>were still three months until <strong>h</strong>.</td>
  <td style="text-align:right;font-weight:bold;">Am 4:7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>The <strong>h</strong> is abundant, but the workers </td>
  <td style="text-align:right;font-weight:bold;">Mt 9:37</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pray to the Lord of the <strong>h</strong> to send </td>
  <td style="text-align:right;font-weight:bold;">Mt 9:38</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>There it is! You remember now that the verse reads "The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few." Now you can see from the listing that it's at Matthew the 9th chapter, specifcally the 37th verse. If you want to know every Bible story that happens in Egypt, just go to the entry and you’ll see every mention of the place.</p>

<h1> What do numbers like “G2326” mean?</h1>
<p>These are from a popular concordance called Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible. Exhaustive here means it contains every single word in the Bible! G2326 is the 2326th Greek word indexed. This system helps pinpoint the exact word you're looking at. For example, there are several words for “love” in the Bible, each with their own index number.</p>

<h1> Which one should I get?</h1>

<p>Concordances are translation-specific, so get one that matches the translation you most often study in. Read the intro to learn how that specific concordance works. Online concordances often have multiple translations for you to explore. An intuitive concordance is www.StepBible.org. Also, www.BibleHub.org has many study tools including a digital Strong’s Concordance.</p>

<h1> Give it a Try!</h1>
<p>Concordances are an invaluable study tool for finding verses, cross-referencing words, and spotting repetition in the Bible.  Finding similarities between verses often yields a whole new layer of context and meaning to what we read on the page.  So don't be afraid to dive right in and give it a try.</p>
