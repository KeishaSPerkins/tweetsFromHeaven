<p> Conflict is just a part of life. We will all at one point or another need tools to resolve it. Let's have a look at some Godly principles for handling times when we don't see eye to eye.</p>

<h2>Avoid Strife and Argument Whenever Possible</h2>

<p> The Bible tells us that we should try to avoid having the argument in the first place. This is not the same as "going along to get along" when a real problem exists. But if there is a way to live peaceably without fighting, we should choose that option.</p>

<div class='bible-text'>The beginning of strife is like letting out water, so quit before the quarrel breaks out.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 17:14 ESV</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
<p class='bible-reference'>Romans 12:18	ESV</p>
</div>

<p> Choosing peace over fighting is a mark of wisdom and honor. And when we make it a goal to live in peace with others, we honor The Father.</p>

<div class='bible-text'>A person of honor will put an argument to rest. Only the stupid want to pick a fight.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 20:3 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Make it your goal to live a quiet life, minding your own business and working with your hands, just as we instructed you before.
<p class='bible-reference'>1 Thessalonians 4:11 NLT</p>
</div>

<h2>Remember Your Goal: Peace</h2>

<p> When tensions rise and arguments break out, it can be easy to forget that we are called to be peace<em>makers</em> as citizens of God's Kingdom. We are to have a goal to bring everyone into right standing. Instead of making it our goal to "win" and argument, we must strive to reconcile with one another.</p>
<div class='bible-text'>Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.
<p class='bible-reference'>Hebrews 12:14 NIV</p>
</div>
<div class='bible-text'>So then, make it your top priority to live a life of peace with harmony in your relationships, eagerly seeking to strengthen and encourage one another.
<p class='bible-reference'>Romans 14:19 TPT</p>
</div>
<p> When to goal at the start is peace, we are much less likely to hurt those around us with words that are meant to do more harm than healing. And when we make peace, we are blessed.</p>

<div class='bible-text'>“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
<p class='bible-reference'>Matthew 5:9 ESV </p>
</div>

<h2>Listen to the Other Person Instead of Just Talking </h2>

<p> If we're always talking, we can never hear what anyone has to say. It is much wiser to <em>listen to</em>--and not just hear--the other person. Because when we just babble on, we may miss something important. </p>

<div class='bible-text'>If one gives an answer before he hears, it is his folly and shame.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 18:13 ESV</p>
</div>

<p> It's also important to know that we may very well be wrong. But how can we find out if we don't honestly listen to the points others are making?</p>

<div class='bible-text'>Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear,
slow to speak, slow to anger;
<p class='bible-reference'>James 1:19 ESV</p>
</div>

<h2>Keep Your Emotions in Check</h2>
<p> A couple things about emotions: they are often false, and usually fleeting. If we allow them to steer the ship, we will be in for a bumpy ride. </p>

<div class='bible-text'>Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear,
slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the
righteousness of God. 
<p class='bible-reference'>James 1:19-20 ESV</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 19:11 ESV</p>
</div>

<p> All of us have experienced a time when emotion ran high and we found ourselves saying something we should not have. But if we take charge of emotion and allow cooler heads to prevail, our relationships will definitely benefit.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Words Wisely</h2>
<p> Have you experienced a time when it wasn't <em>what</em> you said, but <em>how</em> you said it that sparked conflict? Or perhaps a time with just one misplaced word was the trigger? In life, we must be aware not only of the things we say, but how the way we choose to say them.</p>

<div class='bible-text'>A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 15:1 ESV</p>
</div>

<p> So when you talk to people, make sure you choose gentleness in your speech and be mindful of who you're talking to and how they like to be talked to.</p>

<div class='bible-text'>Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.
<p class='bible-reference'>Colossians 4:6 NIV</p>
</div>

<p> A little consideration goes a long way.</p>

<h2>Conflict Resolution Should Be a Priority in Your Relationships</h2>

<p> God made us to be social, to need each other. And we can't really hold on to relationships where conflict cannot be resolved in a healthy way. This is just one reason we have to give priority to resolving conflict. </p>

<p> The Bible tells us that there are times when we need to stop what we're doing and make an effort to reconcile with each other. </p>

<div class='bible-text'>So then, if you are presenting a gift before the altar in the temple and suddenly you remember a quarrel you have with a fellow believer, leave your gift there in front of the altar and go at once to apologize with the one who is offended. Then, after you have reconciled, come to the altar and present your gift.
<p class='bible-reference'>Matthew 5:23-24 TPT</p>
</div>

<p> And we are also told that we should try to resolve anger quickly.</p>
<div class='bible-text'>Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:26 ESV</p>
</div>

<h2>Know that the Consequences of Unresolved Conflict Are Dire</h2>

<p> All of this is resolving and understanding is with the goal of preventing bitterness and hatred in our relationships.</p>

<div class='bible-text'>Watch over each other to make sure that no one misses the revelation of God’s grace. And make sure no one lives with a root of bitterness sprouting within them which will only cause trouble and poison the hearts of many.
<p class='bible-reference'>Hebrews 12:15 TPT</p>
</div>

<p> And when we let bitterness take root in our relationships, it can ultimately be used by our true enemy: the devil. </p>
<div class='bible-text'>Don’t let the sun go down while you are still angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil.
<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:26-27 TPT</p>
</div>

<p> Conflict may be a part of life, but we needn't resolve it just any old way. We have clear instruction that will give us victory even over hurt feelings and heightened emotions. </p>
