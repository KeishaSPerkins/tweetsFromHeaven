<p>When we are in crisis, our emotions can come to overtake us, and we speak rashly. </p>

<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:15 NIV</p>
</div>

<h2>H: Is it Helpful?</h2>
<div class='bible-text'>Don’t use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.
<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:29 NLT</p>
</div>

<h2>I: Is it Inspiring? </h2>
<div class='bible-text'>Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 16:24 NIV</p>
</div>

<h2>N: Is it Necessary? </h2>

<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 10:19 NLT</p>

<p class='bible-reference'>Ephesians 4:32 NLT</p>
