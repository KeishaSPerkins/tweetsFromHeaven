<p>We saw how conviction brings us life and peace while condemnation brings us regret, anxiety, and death. Let's check out two more indicators of which influence we are dealing with.</p>


<h2>Conviction makes you eager to do right</h2>

<p>Conviction gives you new appetites for good things. It shows you that your wrongdoings are not a part of your identity and exposes wonderful parts of you that were previously unseen.</p>

<h2>Condemnation tells you that you can't do right</h2>

<p>Condemnation lies and says that sin is just who you are. It whispers to you that you are inherently terrible and can only do what is wrong. It magnifies shortcomings as "proof" of the lie. </p>

<h2>Conviction gives us a hunger for justice.</h2>

<p>When we've been convicted of the ways we've been unjust, it changes our tolerance for injustice. It makes us want to correct unfairness and speak up against evil.</p>

<h2>Condemnation twists the meaning of justice.</h2>

<p>When we're stuck in the pit of condemnation, injustice can seem like just another part of life. Once you're fooled to think that sin is your identity, standing up against it feels like standing up against yourself.</p>

<p>God wants to make you new!<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup>
 He will surely see to it that you are perfected in Christ,<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-b-reference' href='#footnote-b'>b</a></sup>
 and because God values justice,<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-c-reference' href='#footnote-c'>c</a></sup>
 He wants you to value it, too. Satan wants nothing more than to bring misery, and scorn. He wants you to forget that sin has already been defeated<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-d-reference' href='#footnote-d'>d</a></sup> in your life.</p>

<p>Shake off the weight of condemnation, so that you can stand up, ready to do what is right.</p>
