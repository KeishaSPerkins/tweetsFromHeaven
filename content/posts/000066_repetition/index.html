<p>When we read the Bible, a great tool for understanding is watching out for repetition.</p>

<p>Let's look at just a few examples of how biblical authors can use repetition to cause us to further examine the Scriptures.</p>

<h2>Repetition of Words and phrases</h2>
<p>In the creation narrative found in the first chapter of Genesis, we see God call His creations good <sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup> seven times.</p>

<p>This repetition establishes God as the decider of what is good—and by extension what is not good. It also shows us what good means: order instead of chaos, life instead of death.</p>

<h2>Repetition to Contrast Ideas</h2>
<p>Later in the third chapter, we see humanity decide for itself what is good<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-b-reference' href='#footnote-b'>b</a></sup>, taking the role that has already been established as belonging to God.</p>

<p>What follows is humanity's downfall: exile from the truly good things of the Garden.</p>

<h2>Repetition of Themes </h2>
<p>In chapter four, we see God implore Cain to “do well<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-c-reference' href='#footnote-c'>c</a></sup>” and avoid sin—giving him the same option his parents faced: to do what God has said is good, or to define good for himself.</p>
<p>We know his choice.</p>

<h2>Repetition of Plot</h2>
<p>In chapter 16, after God promises Abram and Sarai a son, their impatience causes them to make the decision that what will be good is to make a baby by their own power. It doesn’t end well.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-d-reference' href='#footnote-d'>d</a></sup></p>

<p>Fast forward a couple generations, and we see that same bad decision play out with Jacob and Rachel.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-e-reference' href='#footnote-e'>e</a></sup></p>

<h2>How do we put this to practice for understanding scripture?</h2>
<p>The next time you are reading and notice repetition, ask yourself what ideas, themes, and points might be at play. Don't be afraid to read a single passage several times to see what you notice. What you find may surprise you.</p>

<p>For instance, the book of Judges may seem like an endorsement of terrible violence and war until you notice that the sentence "In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes"<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-f-reference' href='#footnote-f'>f</a></sup> repeated throughout the book.</p>

<p>There goes that decision about what is good again, and the destruction it brings with it. </p>

<p>The Bible is constantly repeating itself to emphasize points and implore the reader to mull over the scripture and gain wisdom.</p>

<p>What biblical repetitions come to mind? What repeated words, ideas, themes, and plots do you see when you study?</p>
