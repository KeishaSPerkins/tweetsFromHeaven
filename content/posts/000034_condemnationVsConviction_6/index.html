<p>This week, we examined the differences between conviction and condemnation. When trying to discern conviction from condemnation, try asking yourself these questions...</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I truly repenting of this sin? Or am I just trying to follow a rule?</li>
<li>Is this thought designed to help me win? Or is telling me to give up?</li>
<li>Is this making me want to try again after I've fallen? Or is it making me want to wallow in guilt and regret?</li>
<li>Does this thought give me renewed zeal? Or is it sapping me dry?</li>
<li>Is this changing my appetites? Or is it telling me I'll always struggle with this?</li>
<li>Does it make me want to stand up or sit down in the face of injustice?</li>
<li>Does this view my flaws through the filter of Christ's blood or through the lens of the enemy?</li>
<li>Does it make me want to run to God or flee from His presence?</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember: condemnation leaves you trapped in a cycle of negativity. Conviction stops the cycle and gives you a new path. If the sorrow you feel is just making you feel terrible, and not producing any improvements in you, it is not of God.</p>

<p>May God raise your discernment so that you are never trapped in condemnation again, for there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup></p>
