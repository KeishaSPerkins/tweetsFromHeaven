<h2>Kintsugi</h2>

<p>Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum.<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>What a moving portrait of the way the Lord cares for us!</strong></p>

<h3>He remakes us...</h3>
<div class='bible-text'>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: “Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.

<p>Then the word of the Lord came to me. He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the Lord. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel.</p>
<p class='bible-reference'>Jeremiah 18:3-6 NIV</p>
</div>

<h3>So we can love our scars...</h3>
<div class='bible-text'>and He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
<p class='bible-reference'>2 Corinthians 12:9-10 NKJV</p>
</div>

<h3>And see beauty in place of ruin.</h3>
<div class='bible-text'>for those who grieve in Zion...a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair...
<p class='bible-reference'>Isaiah 61:3 NIV</p>
</div>

<p>So what will we say to these cracked and broken hearts? Will we bury our pieces or let the potter put us together again?</p>

<p>Let the Lord mend your brokenness so that you can shine in His light!</p>
