description = "People tell me all the time that they want to read their Bible, but don't know where to begin. And that's understandable! The Bible is a library of letters, poems, stories, and other types of literature that's been bound into one volume. It can be intimidating to say the least! Maybe knowing a little about how the Bible is organized can help you decide where you want to begin. But wherever you start, rest assured that the words you're reading will do great things!"
