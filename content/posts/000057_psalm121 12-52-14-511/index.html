<div class='bible-text'>I look up to the mountains and hills, longing for God’s help.<br>
But then I realize that our true help and protection<br>
come only from the Lord,<br>
our Creator who made the heavens and the earth.<br>
He will guard and guide me, never letting me stumble or fall.<br>
God is my keeper; he will never forget nor ignore me.<br>
He will never slumber nor sleep;<br>
he is the Guardian-God for his people, Israel.<br>
Jehovah himself will watch over you;<br>
he’s always at your side to shelter you safely in his presence.<br>
He’s protecting you from all danger both day and night.<br>
He will keep you from every form of evil or calamity<br>
as he continually watches over you.<br>
You will be guarded by God himself.<br>
You will be safe when you leave your home<br>
and safely you will return.<br>
He will protect you now,<br>
and he’ll protect you forevermore!
