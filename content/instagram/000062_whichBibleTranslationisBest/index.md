**Short answer:** There isn't one. You should read as many translations as you can! But how do you pick one to read right now?

Each translation is trying to strike a balance between being easy to read and understand, and being true to the original language. Some translations are going for a word-for-word representation while others may be going for a thought-for-thought translation. And others are more like a paraphrasing of the original text.

For instance, when an idiom like "It rained cats and dogs" is translated from English, should the translator map those exact words onto the target language? Or should they simply say "There was a huge rain storm"? The first option is "correct" in that it is true to the words in English, but will a non-English speaker understand that animals are not falling from the sky? 

These are the types of questions translators ask themselves. And these questions come up no matter what is being translated, because every language and culture is different.

At the end of the day, it's best to **choose a translation that helps you understand** what is being said. Let's look at a few popular translations and where they fall on this spectrum.
