Previously, we saw how condemnation leads us to legalism and failure while conviction leads us to repentance and victory. Let's continue to look at these two influencesÂ and their affect on the believer.

## Conviction doesn't leave you in regret

Conviction corrects without harping and badgering, peacefully pointing you in the right direction. You needn't feel lost in guilt. You are redeemed through Christ.

## Condemnation covers you in the residue of your past
	
Condemnation rehashes old wrongs and nags, even after you've corrected course. The point is to trap you in feelings of guilt and anxiety so that you waste time in self-pity and self-punishment.

## Conviction brings life
	
Conviction spurs you on and gives zeal! It allows truth to set you free so that you can try again. It looks to tomorrow with hope.

## Condemnation works death
	
Condemnation saps your energy stresses you, making you sick with shame. It tells you that you are hopeless against sin and asks, "Why even try?"

Again, these differences come down to motive: God wants good things for you. Satan does not.

God doesn't want you trapped in regret, unable to live. He wants you to live abundantly,<sup><a class='footnote-reference' id='footnote-a-reference' href='#footnote-a'>a</a></sup>
