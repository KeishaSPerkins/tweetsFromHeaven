Friendship is so vital to our lives. Let's look at what the Bible has to say about friends.

## Friends Weather the Storm Together 

<div class='bible-text'>A friend is always loyal, and a brother is born to help in time of need.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 17:17 NLT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>So never give up on a friend or abandon a friend of your father—for in the day of your brokenness you won’t have to run to a relative for help. A friend nearby is better than a relative far away.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 27:10 TPT</p>
</div>

## Friends Help Each Other Succeed

<div class='bible-text'>Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble.
<p class='bible-reference'>Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 NASB</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 27:17 NIV</p>
</div>

## Friendship is Not One-Sided

<div class='bible-text'>A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 18:24 KJV</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>In everything you do, be careful to treat others in the same way you’d want them to treat you, for that is the essence of all the teachings of the Law and the Prophets.
<p class='bible-reference'>Matthew 7:12 TPT</p>
</div>


## Friends Should Be Chosen Wisely

<div class='bible-text'>He who walks with wise men will be wise, But the companion of fools will suffer harm.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 13:20 NASB</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>So stop fooling yourselves! Evil companions will corrupt good morals and character.
<p class='bible-reference'>1 Corinthians 15:33 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person, do not associate with one easily angered, or you may learn their ways and get yourself ensnared.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 22:24-25 NIV</p>
</div>

## Friends Who Give Constructive Criticism 

<div class='bible-text'>You can trust a friend who wounds you with his honesty, but your enemy’s pretended flattery comes from insincerity.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 27:6 TPT</p>
</div>

<div class='bible-text'>If you correct someone with constructive criticism, in the end he will appreciate it more than flattery.
<p class='bible-reference'>Proverbs 28:23 TPT</p>
</div>

What about your friends? 

Are your friendships built to last? Are they reciprocal and constructive? Are you paired with people who will help you succeed?
