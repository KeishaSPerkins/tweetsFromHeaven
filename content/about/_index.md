## Tweets From Heaven
Tweets From Heaven is an attempt to make the Bible more approachable and explain how it can apply to our everyday lives. Tweets From Heaven operates on the promise that when Christ is lifted, people are drawn from all around. Starting in 2019, it may be young, but is already reaching and teaching people about the treasures found in God's Word.

Whether you are new to the Bible or have been reading it for years, our prayer is that you find something meaningful and useful here. The Bible is alive and can bring life to you.
