When we read the Bible, sometimes we just read the words on the page and move on. But what about when we want to get a little more understanding from the text? Is there a systematic way of breaking down scripture so that we get to its deeper meanings? 

There are actually many methods for this, but we'll focus on one today: The S.O.A.P. Method.
## What Does SOAP Stand For?
### S - Scripture</strong>

Take the time to write the scripture out, or at least read it carefully—taking time to notice each word. Just taking the time to slow down with the Word does wonders for how we understand it.

### O - Observation</strong>

What do you see in the text? What type of literature is it? Who are the characters? Who is the audience? Do you see pattern or repetition in the words? How is it structured?

### A - Application</strong>

What is God speaking to you today? This is where we also depend on the Spirit to bring revelation. Do you see instructions in the scripture? What form do they take?

### P - Prayer</strong>

Pray God's Word back to Him. Using the observations you made and the applications to your own life that you've found, share your heart with God.

## Let's Practice 
We'll take a short parable found in Mark to work with. Let's start with our scripture:

<div class='bible-text'>And He was saying, “The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil; and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows—how, he himself does not know. The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head. But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”
<p class='bible-reference'>Mark 4:26-29 NASB</p>
</div>

### O - Observation:
- We are getting a glimpse of how the Kingdom of God functions
- Farmers plant crops, but aren't directly involved in making them grow
- The growth happens on its own in the soil
- There is a process and order to crops growing
- When the crop is ready, it is immediately harvested 

### A - Application
If we take the seed to be the Word of God, we can see a metaphor being laid out. When we share the Word of God, we don't know how that living Word is working on those that hear it—a person's heart is hidden from other people. But as we go on about our days the Word works in our heart, bringing forth fruit. And when our spiritual fruit is ripe, God is ready to immediately harvest it and put it to use.

### P - Prayer
Lord, thank You for Your Word. It is like a living seed deep in my heart, working in ways that I can't even see.

Thank You for the gradual, ordered way Your Word grows in my heart and mind, bringing forth fruit in season.

When my fruit is ripe, I invite You to harvest it and put it to good use for Your kingdom. Amen.

## Keep Going!
This is just one way of viewing this scripture. You'll probably notice other things and the Spirit may show you something else specific to your life. 

Keep practicing with this method; it will be so beneficial in your study.
