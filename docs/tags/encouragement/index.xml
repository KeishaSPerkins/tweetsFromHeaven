      <description>Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor! The Lord rescues them when they are in trouble. The Lord protects them and keeps them alive. He gives them prosperity in the land and rescues them from their enemies. Psalm 41:1-2 NLT
 Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to poverty will be cursed. Proverbs 28:27 NLT
 And whoever gives a cup of cold water to one of my humble disciples, I promise you, he will not go unrewarded.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been feeling down, and reached for the Bible for encouragement, only to feel that it just didn&#39;t work? Does this mean that scripture is just not good for encouragement? Or could there be another problem?
What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways! ... His pleasure and passion is remaining true to the Word of “I Am,” meditating day and night in the true revelation of light.</description>

      <description>I know the Lord is always with me. I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me. Psalm 16:8 NLT
 Stop imitating the ideals and opinions of the culture around you, but be inwardly transformed by the Holy Spirit through a total reformation of how you think. This will empower you to discern God’s will as you live a beautiful life, satisfying and perfect in his eyes.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s so easy to rush through life, eager to turn the next corner. Or to look back and wonder why it took so long to know what you know now. But the Bible tells us that God is strategic and purposeful about time. Let&#39;s see what wisdom the Bible has for us concerning timing.
There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven— Ecclesiastes 3:1 NASB</description>

      <description>Have you heard this scripture...
When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. Isaiah 59:19b KJV
 But What Does &#34;Standard&#34; Mean Here? The word &#34;standard&#34; originates from Middle English, and refers to a flag raised on a pole as a rallying point in battle. It is an object that soldiers can look for to find where allies are.</description>

      <description>Kintsugi Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum.a
What a moving portrait of the way the Lord cares for us!
He remakes us... This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: “Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel.</description>

      <description>Have you noticed that just as you&#39;re entering a growth season, you are often slammed with a trial?
Don&#39;t fear! It is only a scarecrow! Its purpose is to distract you from the bountiful fields just ahead!
And a man in the crowd shouted desperately, “Please, Teacher, I beg of you, do something about my boy. He’s my only child. He’s possessed by an evil spirit that makes him scream out in torment and hardly ever leaves him alone.</description>
