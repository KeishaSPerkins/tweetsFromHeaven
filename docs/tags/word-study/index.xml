      <description>Dominion Given In the book of Genesis, we see God give humanity dominion over all of creation. He instruct humans to subdue the earth.a Does this mean we can do whatever we want? After all, we&#39;ve got dominion!b. We are to subdue creation!c
Let&#39;s look in the second chapter for some insight:
And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dressd it and to keepe it.</description>

      <description>Have you heard this scripture...
When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. Isaiah 59:19b KJV
 But What Does &#34;Standard&#34; Mean Here? The word &#34;standard&#34; originates from Middle English, and refers to a flag raised on a pole as a rallying point in battle. It is an object that soldiers can look for to find where allies are.</description>
