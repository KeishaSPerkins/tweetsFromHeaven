      <description>Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor! The Lord rescues them when they are in trouble. The Lord protects them and keeps them alive. He gives them prosperity in the land and rescues them from their enemies. Psalm 41:1-2 NLT
 Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to poverty will be cursed. Proverbs 28:27 NLT
 And whoever gives a cup of cold water to one of my humble disciples, I promise you, he will not go unrewarded.</description>

What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways! ... His pleasure and passion is remaining true to the Word of “I Am,” meditating day and night in the true revelation of light.</description>

      <description>I know the Lord is always with me. I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me. Psalm 16:8 NLT
 Stop imitating the ideals and opinions of the culture around you, but be inwardly transformed by the Holy Spirit through a total reformation of how you think. This will empower you to discern God’s will as you live a beautiful life, satisfying and perfect in his eyes.</description>
