      <description>Sometimes as creatives, we can get caught up in the works of our handsâ€”blinded by the likes and shares and affirmation. But let&#39;s take a moment to say what God says about human creativity.
Lord, I thank You for the complexity of my mind. For it is through You that I am able to create. Psalm 139:14, Acts 17:28
As I create, I am always listening for Your voice to guide me.</description>
