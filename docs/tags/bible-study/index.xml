Let&#39;s look at just a few examples of how biblical authors can use repetition to cause us to further examine the Scriptures.

      <description>Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor! The Lord rescues them when they are in trouble. The Lord protects them and keeps them alive. He gives them prosperity in the land and rescues them from their enemies. Psalm 41:1-2 NLT
 Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to poverty will be cursed. Proverbs 28:27 NLT
 And whoever gives a cup of cold water to one of my humble disciples, I promise you, he will not go unrewarded.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been feeling down, and reached for the Bible for encouragement, only to feel that it just didn&#39;t work? Does this mean that scripture is just not good for encouragement? Or could there be another problem?
What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways! ... His pleasure and passion is remaining true to the Word of “I Am,” meditating day and night in the true revelation of light.</description>
