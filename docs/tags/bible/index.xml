      <description>Short answer: There isn&#39;t one. You should read as many translations as you can! But how do you pick one to read right now?
Each translation is trying to strike a balance between being easy to read and understand, and being true to the original language. Some translations are going for a word-for-word representation while others may be going for a thought-for-thought translation. And others are more like a paraphrasing of the original text.</description>
