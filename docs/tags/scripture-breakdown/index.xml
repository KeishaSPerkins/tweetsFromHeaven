      <description>This week, we examined the differences between conviction and condemnation. When trying to discern conviction from condemnation, try asking yourself these questions...
 Am I truly repenting of this sin? Or am I just trying to follow a rule? Is this thought designed to help me win? Or is telling me to give up? Is this making me want to try again after I&#39;ve fallen? Or is it making me want to wallow in guilt and regret?</description>

      <title>Spotting Condemnation Posing as Conviction: Part 5</title>

      <description>Yesterday, we saw how conviction gives us appetites for justice while condemnation ultimately pulls us to do wrong. Let&#39;s continue examining godly sorrow and how it contrasts with the sorrow of the world.
Conviction shows you how God sees you. We all sin and come short. God does not hide that fact, but when God views us, He does so in the light of Christ&#39;s sacrifice. So that though we are flawed, we are made righteous through the Son.</description>

      <title>Spotting Condemnation Posing as Conviction: Part 4</title>

      <description>We saw how conviction brings us life and peace while condemnation brings us regret, anxiety, and death. Let&#39;s check out two more indicators of which influence we are dealing with.
Conviction makes you eager to do right Conviction gives you new appetites for good things. It shows you that your wrongdoings are not a part of your identity and exposes wonderful parts of you that were previously unseen.
Condemnation tells you that you can&#39;t do right Condemnation lies and says that sin is just who you are.</description>

      <title>Spotting Condemnation Posing as Conviction: Part 3</title>

      <description>Previously, we saw how condemnation leads us to legalism and failure while conviction leads us to repentance and victory. Let&#39;s continue to look at these two influences and their affect on the believer.
Conviction doesn&#39;t leave you in regret Conviction corrects without harping and badgering, peacefully pointing you in the right direction. You needn&#39;t feel lost in guilt. You are redeemed through Christ.
Condemnation covers you in the residue of your past Condemnation rehashes old wrongs and nags, even after you&#39;ve corrected course.</description>

      <description>Last time, we looked at an illustration of godly sorrow and how it affects our lives. Let&#39;s start contrasting conviction from God with condemnation from the enemy.
True Conviction Leads to True Repentance Godly sorrow brings about a change of heart. It might make you a little sad, but that sadness quickly gives way to a renewed way of thinking.
Condemnation Just Leads to Legalism Condemnation causes forced behavioral change and rigid rule-following.</description>

      <description>One of the enemy&#39;s favorite tricks is to try to bring condemnation to God&#39;s people.
&#34;Satan&#34; means &#34;accuser&#34; and he never fails to live up to the title. But not only does he accuse, he lies and says it is coming from God!
Let&#39;s look at what Paul called &#34;godly sorrow,&#34; a perfect picture of Christian conviction.
Even if my letter made you sorrowful, I don’t regret sending it (even though I felt awful for a moment when I heard how it grieved you).</description>
