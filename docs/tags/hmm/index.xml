When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. Isaiah 59:19b KJV
 But What Does &#34;Standard&#34; Mean Here? The word &#34;standard&#34; originates from Middle English, and refers to a flag raised on a pole as a rallying point in battle. It is an object that soldiers can look for to find where allies are.</description>

These three young men were thrown into a large furnace as punishment for refusing to worship a statue of the king.</description>
