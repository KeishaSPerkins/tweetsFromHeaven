      <description>What is S.P.A.C.E. P.E.T.S.? Earlier this week, we talked about the S.O.A.P. Method for Bible study. Today, we&#39;ll talk about a method that can go hand-in-hand with it to help us with the &#34;Application&#34; part of the S.O.A.P. Method: S.P.A.C.E. P.E.T.S.
With space pets, you ask yourself if you can find any of these in the text:
  S: Sin to confess  P: Promise to claim  A: Attitude to change  C: Command to obey  E: Example to follow  P: Prayer to pray  E: Error to avoid  T: Truth to believe  S: Something to praise God for  When we try to apply the Bible to our lives, it can seem hard because the Bible is an ancient library of books written by and to an ancient people.</description>

      <description>When we read the Bible, sometimes we just read the words on the page and move on. But what about when we want to get a little more understanding from the text? Is there a systematic way of breaking down scripture so that we get to its deeper meanings? There are actually many methods for this, but we&#39;ll focus on one today: The S.O.A.P. Method.
What Does SOAP Stand For?</description>

      <description>What is a Bible concordance? A Bible concordance is an index of words used in the Bible and a reference for where each word occurs within the Bible.
There are many free online concordances, and you can also buy them in print.
 Why would I use a concordance? Concordances are useful for finding passages. Only remember one word from a passage you want to find? Looking for passages that refer to the same topics and concepts as the one you&#39;re reading?</description>
