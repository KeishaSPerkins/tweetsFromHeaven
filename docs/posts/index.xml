      <description>Sometimes as creatives, we can get caught up in the works of our hands—blinded by the likes and shares and affirmation. But let&#39;s take a moment to say what God says about human creativity.
Lord, I thank You for the complexity of my mind. For it is through You that I am able to create. Psalm 139:14, Acts 17:28
As I create, I am always listening for Your voice to guide me.</description>

      <description>Dominion Given In the book of Genesis, we see God give humanity dominion over all of creation. He instruct humans to subdue the earth.a Does this mean we can do whatever we want? After all, we&#39;ve got dominion!b. We are to subdue creation!c
Let&#39;s look in the second chapter for some insight:
And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dressd it and to keepe it.</description>

      <description>Catch all the foxes, those little foxes, before they ruin the vineyard of love, for the grapevines are blossoming! Song of Solomon 2:15 NLT
 Here, the vineyard is the budding relationship between the couple in the poem. The foxes represent issues that tear relationships apart. What lesson can we glean from fox behavior so that me way protect our relationships?

      <description>Sometimes fear and worry can make us cower when we should be standing tall. As we end this year, let&#39;s say what God says so that we may boldly step into tomorrow.
Lord thank You for Your promises that free me from the fruitless task of worry. Matthew 6:31-34, Matthew 6:27
Your Word implores me to be bold and courageous—and to resist fear and impatience. Psalm 27:14
Lord, my belief in You has the power to move mountains in my life.</description>

      <description>When we read the Bible, a great tool for understanding is watching out for repetition.
Let&#39;s look at just a few examples of how biblical authors can use repetition to cause us to further examine the Scriptures.
Repetition of Words and phrases In the creation narrative found in the first chapter of Genesis, we see God call His creations good a seven times.
This repetition establishes God as the decider of what is good—and by extension what is not good.</description>

      <description>I our fast paced, appearance driven society it can be tempting to seek status above everything else. But what does the Bible say about humility? He leads the humble in justice, And He teaches the humble His way. Psalm 25:9 NASB
 Lift yourself up with pride and you will soon be brought low, but a meek and humble spirit will add to your honor. Proverbs 29:23 TPT
 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up in honor.</description>

      <title>Which Bible Translation is Best</title>
      <link>https://festive-mcclintock-6dbef7.netlify.app/posts/000062_whichbibletranslationisbest/</link>

      <guid>https://festive-mcclintock-6dbef7.netlify.app/posts/000062_whichbibletranslationisbest/</guid>
      <description>Short answer: There isn&#39;t one. You should read as many translations as you can! But how do you pick one to read right now?
Each translation is trying to strike a balance between being easy to read and understand, and being true to the original language. Some translations are going for a word-for-word representation while others may be going for a thought-for-thought translation. And others are more like a paraphrasing of the original text.</description>

 Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to poverty will be cursed. Proverbs 28:27 NLT

      <description>Have you ever been feeling down, and reached for the Bible for encouragement, only to feel that it just didn&#39;t work? Does this mean that scripture is just not good for encouragement? Or could there be another problem?
What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways! ... His pleasure and passion is remaining true to the Word of “I Am,” meditating day and night in the true revelation of light.</description>

      <description>I look up to the mountains and hills, longing for God’s help.
But then I realize that our true help and protection
come only from the Lord,
our Creator who made the heavens and the earth.
He will guard and guide me, never letting me stumble or fall.
God is my keeper; he will never forget nor ignore me.
He will never slumber nor sleep;
he is the Guardian-God for his people, Israel.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s so easy to rush through life, eager to turn the next corner. Or to look back and wonder why it took so long to know what you know now. But the Bible tells us that God is strategic and purposeful about time. Let&#39;s see what wisdom the Bible has for us concerning timing.
There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven— Ecclesiastes 3:1 NASB</description>

 So never give up on a friend or abandon a friend of your father—for in the day of your brokenness you won’t have to run to a relative for help.</description>

      <description>What is S.P.A.C.E. P.E.T.S.? Earlier this week, we talked about the S.O.A.P. Method for Bible study. Today, we&#39;ll talk about a method that can go hand-in-hand with it to help us with the &#34;Application&#34; part of the S.O.A.P. Method: S.P.A.C.E. P.E.T.S.
With space pets, you ask yourself if you can find any of these in the text:
  S: Sin to confess  P: Promise to claim  A: Attitude to change  C: Command to obey  E: Example to follow  P: Prayer to pray  E: Error to avoid  T: Truth to believe  S: Something to praise God for  When we try to apply the Bible to our lives, it can seem hard because the Bible is an ancient library of books written by and to an ancient people.</description>

      <description>When we read the Bible, sometimes we just read the words on the page and move on. But what about when we want to get a little more understanding from the text? Is there a systematic way of breaking down scripture so that we get to its deeper meanings? There are actually many methods for this, but we&#39;ll focus on one today: The S.O.A.P. Method.

      <description>When we are in crisis circumstance can make us want to rush into action. We run forward to solve problems, forgetting that our first step should be prayer.
Here are a few short prayers that speak God&#39;s Word over our lives. Let&#39;s say what God says in this season.
Overcoming Worry Lord, I thank You for Your logic-defying peace as I come to Your throne.a Because I trust You, I know that You keep me in perfect peace and keep my mind whole.</description>

      <description>When we are in crisis it can be hard to keep our focus in a healthy place. If we let our thoughts run wild, our fear can overwhelm us. But the Bible lets us know where our focus should lie.
Focus on Jesus We look away from the natural realm and we fasten our gaze onto Jesus who birthed faith within us and who leads us forward into faith’s perfection.</description>

      <description>When we are in crisis, our emotions can come to overtake us, and we speak rashly. But even as you walk through chaos, it&#39;s important to T.H.I.N.K. before you speak.
T: Is it True? Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. Ephesians 4:15 NIV
 H: Is it Helpful? Don’t use foul or abusive language.</description>

      <description>Kintsugi Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum.a
What a moving portrait of the way the Lord cares for us!
He remakes us... This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: “Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel.</description>

      <description>Have you noticed that just as you&#39;re entering a growth season, you are often slammed with a trial?
Don&#39;t fear! It is only a scarecrow! Its purpose is to distract you from the bountiful fields just ahead!
And a man in the crowd shouted desperately, “Please, Teacher, I beg of you, do something about my boy. He’s my only child. He’s possessed by an evil spirit that makes him scream out in torment and hardly ever leaves him alone.</description>

      <title>Spotting Condemnation Posing as Conviction: Finale</title>

      <description>This week, we examined the differences between conviction and condemnation. When trying to discern conviction from condemnation, try asking yourself these questions...
 Am I truly repenting of this sin? Or am I just trying to follow a rule? Is this thought designed to help me win? Or is telling me to give up? Is this making me want to try again after I&#39;ve fallen? Or is it making me want to wallow in guilt and regret?</description>

      <description>Yesterday, we saw how conviction gives us appetites for justice while condemnation ultimately pulls us to do wrong. Let&#39;s continue examining godly sorrow and how it contrasts with the sorrow of the world.
Conviction shows you how God sees you. We all sin and come short. God does not hide that fact, but when God views us, He does so in the light of Christ&#39;s sacrifice. So that though we are flawed, we are made righteous through the Son.</description>

      <description>We saw how conviction brings us life and peace while condemnation brings us regret, anxiety, and death. Let&#39;s check out two more indicators of which influence we are dealing with.
Conviction makes you eager to do right Conviction gives you new appetites for good things. It shows you that your wrongdoings are not a part of your identity and exposes wonderful parts of you that were previously unseen.
Condemnation tells you that you can&#39;t do right Condemnation lies and says that sin is just who you are.</description>

      <description>Previously, we saw how condemnation leads us to legalism and failure while conviction leads us to repentance and victory. Let&#39;s continue to look at these two influences and their affect on the believer.
Conviction doesn&#39;t leave you in regret Conviction corrects without harping and badgering, peacefully pointing you in the right direction. You needn&#39;t feel lost in guilt. You are redeemed through Christ.
Condemnation covers you in the residue of your past Condemnation rehashes old wrongs and nags, even after you&#39;ve corrected course.</description>

      <description>Last time, we looked at an illustration of godly sorrow and how it affects our lives. Let&#39;s start contrasting conviction from God with condemnation from the enemy.
True Conviction Leads to True Repentance Godly sorrow brings about a change of heart. It might make you a little sad, but that sadness quickly gives way to a renewed way of thinking.
Condemnation Just Leads to Legalism Condemnation causes forced behavioral change and rigid rule-following.</description>

      <description>One of the enemy&#39;s favorite tricks is to try to bring condemnation to God&#39;s people.
&#34;Satan&#34; means &#34;accuser&#34; and he never fails to live up to the title. But not only does he accuse, he lies and says it is coming from God!
Let&#39;s look at what Paul called &#34;godly sorrow,&#34; a perfect picture of Christian conviction.
Even if my letter made you sorrowful, I don’t regret sending it (even though I felt awful for a moment when I heard how it grieved you).</description>

      <description>The Bible is full of practical advice for life. Let’s look at what it says about meddling in other people’s affairs.
It’s better to grab a mad dog by its ears than to meddle and interfere in a quarrel that’s none of your business. Proverbs 26:17 TPT
 Aspire to lead a calm and peaceful life as you mind your own business and earn your living, just as we’ve taught you.</description>

      <description>## Identities Under Attack Sometimes, our identities are called into question or even outright attacked. We&#39;ll look to the &#34;Three Hebrew Boys&#34; to find an example of what it looks like to withstand an attack on who we are.   The story of the Three Hebrew Boys may be familiar to you. These three young men were thrown into a large furnace as punishment for refusing to worship a statue of the king.</description>
