What lesson can we glean from fox behavior so that me way protect our relationships?\nPossessiveness Foxes mark their territory with unpleasant scents and droppings so that other animals know they own the place. In any relationship, it is not one person who owns the other like a toy or trinket—so possessiveness has no place. Resist the urge to mark and defend a person like property. Instead, trust their decision to be in relationship with you.\nBitterness and Grudges Foxes raid waste and compost bins and dig up flowerbeds, making a mess and spoiling a garden.\nBitterness has no place in a loving relationship. Instead of burying conflict only to dig it up after it smells, deal with your frustrations and get rid of grudges.\nPassive Aggression (\"False\" Alarms) Foxes make screaming calls that can sound like a person in distress when there is no actual danger.\nWhen we are hurting in relationship, it's important to address the issue at hand and not mask what we're actually upset about. Don't sound the wrong alarm; make what you are feeling plain.\nCollateral Damage Foxes can eat small pets like cats or rabbits, and make your yard unsafe for them.\nThose around us do not deserve to suffer because there is a breakdown in a relationship.

It also shows us what good means: order instead of chaos, life instead of death.\nRepetition to Contrast Ideas Later in the third chapter, we see humanity decide for itself what is goodb, taking the role that has already been established as belonging to God.\nWhat follows is humanity's downfall: exile from the truly good things of the Garden.\nRepetition of Themes  In chapter four, we see God implore Cain to “do wellc” and avoid sin—giving him the same option his parents faced: to do what God has said is good, or to define good for himself.\nWe know his choice.\nRepetition of Plot In chapter 16, after God promises Abram and Sarai a son, their impatience causes them to make the decision that what will be good is to make a baby by their own power. It doesn’t end well.d\nFast forward a couple generations, and we see that same bad decision play out with Jacob and Rachel.e\nHow do we put this to practice for understanding scripture? The next time you are reading and notice repetition, ask yourself what ideas, themes, and points might be at play. Don't be afraid to read a single passage several times to see what you notice. What you find may surprise you.\nFor instance, the book of Judges may seem like an endorsement of terrible violence and war until you notice that the sentence \"In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes\"f repeated throughout the book.\nThere goes that decision about what is good again, and the destruction it brings with it. The Bible is constantly repeating itself to emphasize points and implore the reader to mull over the scripture and gain wisdom.\nWhat biblical repetitions come to mind?

You should read as many translations as you can! But how do you pick one to read right now?\nEach translation is trying to strike a balance between being easy to read and understand, and being true to the original language. Some translations are going for a word-for-word representation while others may be going for a thought-for-thought translation. And others are more like a paraphrasing of the original text.\nFor instance, when an idiom like \"It rained cats and dogs\" is translated from English, should the translator map those exact words onto the target language? Or should they simply say \"There was a huge rain storm\"? The first option is \"correct\" in that it is true to the words in English, but will a non-English speaker understand that animals are not falling from the sky? These are the types of questions translators ask themselves. And these questions come up no matter what is being translated, because every language and culture is different.\nAt the end of the day, it's best to choose a translation that helps you understand what is being said.

Proverbs 22:24-25 NIV\n Friends Who Give Constructive Criticism  You can trust a friend who wounds you with his honesty, but your enemy’s pretended flattery comes from insincerity.

P.E.T.S.? Earlier this week, we talked about the S.O.A.P. Method for Bible study. Today, we'll talk about a method that can go hand-in-hand with it to help us with the \"Application\" part of the S.O.A.P. Method: S.P.A.C.E. P.E.T.S.\nWith space pets, you ask yourself if you can find any of these in the text:\n  S: Sin to confess  P: Promise to claim  A: Attitude to change  C: Command to obey  E: Example to follow  P: Prayer to pray  E: Error to avoid  T: Truth to believe  S: Something to praise God for  When we try to apply the Bible to our lives, it can seem hard because the Bible is an ancient library of books written by and to an ancient people. Some of the cultural context can get in the way of it feeling relatable. During times like these, it can help to ask if we find any of the elements of SPACE PETS in the scripture.\nLet's practice. What do you see in this passage about the older brother of the famed prodigal son?\n“The older brother was angry and wouldn’t go in. His father came out and begged him, but he replied, ‘All these years I’ve slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to. And in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends. Yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the fattened calf!’ Luke 15:28-30 NLT\n Do you see...   Sin to confess: have you been unforgiving and vengeful?  Attitude to change: is there an issue you refuse to budge on that's hurting those around you?  Error to avoid: are you refusing to celebrate the successes of others?  What others do you see?\nLet's keep practicing. How about the woman in the parable of the lost coin?\n“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Won’t she light a lamp and sweep the entire house and search carefully until she finds it? And when she finds it, she will call in her friends and neighbors and say, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost coin.’ In the same way, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels when even one sinner repents.” Luke 15:8-10 NLT\n  Example to follow: how tenacious are you in going after goals? Truth to believe: God searches us out, and will stop at nothing to be with us. Something to praise God for: What losses has God redeemed in your life, giving you reason to celebrate?  Do you see others?\nKeep Going! S.P.A.C.E. P.E.T.S is a great method for applying the Bible to your life.

But what about when we want to get a little more understanding from the text? Is there a systematic way of breaking down scripture so that we get to its deeper meanings? There are actually many methods for this, but we'll focus on one today: The S.O.A.P. Method.\nWhat Does SOAP Stand For? S - Scripture Take the time to write the scripture out, or at least read it carefully—taking time to notice each word. Just taking the time to slow down with the Word does wonders for how we understand it.\nO - Observation What do you see in the text? What type of literature is it? Who are the characters? Who is the audience? Do you see pattern or repetition in the words? How is it structured?\nA - Application \nWhat is God speaking to you today? This is where we also depend on the Spirit to bring revelation. Do you see instructions in the scripture? What form do they take?\nP - Prayer Pray God's Word back to Him. Using the observations you made and the applications to your own life that you've found, share your heart with God.\nLet's Practice  We'll take a short parable found in Mark to work with. Let's start with our scripture:\nAnd He was saying, “The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil; and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows—how, he himself does not know. The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head. But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.” Mark 4:26-29 NASB\n O - Observation:  We are getting a glimpse of how the Kingdom of God functions Farmers plant crops, but aren't directly involved in making them grow The growth happens on its own in the soil There is a process and order to crops growing When the crop is ready, it is immediately harvested   A - Application If we take the seed to be the Word of God, we can see a metaphor being laid out. When we share the Word of God, we don't know how that living Word is working on those that hear it—a person's heart is hidden from other people. But as we go on about our days the Word works in our heart, bringing forth fruit. And when our spiritual fruit is ripe, God is ready to immediately harvest it and put it to use.\nP - Prayer Lord, thank You for Your Word. It is like a living seed deep in my heart, working in ways that I can't even see.\nThank You for the gradual, ordered way Your Word grows in my heart and mind, bringing forth fruit in season.\nWhen my fruit is ripe, I invite You to harvest it and put it to good use for Your kingdom. Amen.\nKeep Going! This is just one way of viewing this scripture. You'll probably notice other things and the Spirit may show you something else specific to your life. Keep practicing with this method; it will be so beneficial in your study.\n            View this post on Instagram                    A post shared by Tweets From Heaven (@tweets.from.heaven)\n  ","permalink":"https://festive-mcclintock-6dbef7.netlify.app/posts/000049_thesoapmethod/","tags":["practical","study","study tools","study methods"],"title":"The S.O.A.P.

A Bible concordance is an index of words used in the Bible and a reference for where each word occurs within the Bible.\nThere are many free online concordances, and you can also buy them in print.\n Why would I use a concordance? Concordances are useful for finding passages. Only remember one word from a passage you want to find? Looking for passages that refer to the same topics and concepts as the one you're reading? A concordance can help with that!\n How do I use a concordance? Let's say you know there's a verse that talks about harvests, but you can't quite remember where it is or exactly how it’s worded. Looking up the entry for “harvest” may lead you to something that looks like this:\n  were still three months until h. Am 4:7   The h is abundant, but the workers  Mt 9:37   pray to the Lord of the h to send  Mt 9:38    There it is! You remember now that the verse reads \"The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few.\" Now you can see from the listing that it's at Matthew the 9th chapter, specifcally the 37th verse. If you want to know every Bible story that happens in Egypt, just go to the entry and you’ll see every mention of the place.\n What do numbers like “G2326” mean? These are from a popular concordance called Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible. Exhaustive here means it contains every single word in the Bible! G2326 is the 2326th Greek word indexed. This system helps pinpoint the exact word you're looking at. For example, there are several words for “love” in the Bible, each with their own index number.\n Which one should I get? Concordances are translation-specific, so get one that matches the translation you most often study in. Read the intro to learn how that specific concordance works. Online concordances often have multiple translations for you to explore. An intuitive concordance is www.StepBible.org. Also, www.BibleHub.org has many study tools including a digital Strong’s Concordance.\n Give it a Try! Concordances are an invaluable study tool for finding verses, cross-referencing words, and spotting repetition in the Bible. Finding similarities between verses often yields a whole new layer of context and meaning to what we read on the page. So don't be afraid to dive right in and give it a try.\n            View this post on Instagram                    A post shared by Tweets From Heaven (@tweets.from.heaven)\n   ","permalink":"https://festive-mcclintock-6dbef7.netlify.app/posts/000048_concordances/","tags":["practical","study","study tools"],"title":" Bible Study Tools: Concordance"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Perhaps you've seen this verse:\nAnd we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

He has given us wisdom for navigating deals and dilemnas! Let's look at some of the advice the Bible gives us about business.\nRemember That it is Really God's Business It can be easy to think that the businesses we run are ours alone. But the truth is that we are stewarding all that we have. We must keep God at the forefront of everything we do, because it his God who gives us the power to do it. And if we lose sight of this truth, and begin to boast and become puffed up about the successes of our businesses, we may find that success turned around. After all, pride come before the fall!\nRemember the Lord your God. He is the one who gives you power to be successful, in order to fulfill the covenant he confirmed to your ancestors with an oath. Deuteronomy 8:18 NLT\n Your boast becomes a prophecy of a future failure. The higher you lift up yourself in pride, the harder you’ll fall in disgrace. Proverbs 16:18 TPT\n Always Seek Direction from God It's tempting to try to figure out things in our own power, to work hard to find our own way. But the Spirit gives us direction and warnings to lead us to victory and away from ruin. Not consulting the Lord for your business is refusing to use the best tool at your disposal!\nBecause we are only human--having limited knowledge and understanding--we can't possibly know better which way to turn than God's Spirit. But the beautiful news is that we have access to the Spirit who prompts us (in real time) about the things we need to do.\nTrust in the Lord completely, and do not rely on your own opinions. With all your heart rely on him to guide you, and he will lead you in every decision you make. Proverbs 3:5 TPT\n Your own ears will hear him Right behind you a voice will say, “This is the way you should go,” whether to the right or to the left. Isaiah 30:21 NLT\n It is when we trust God fully that we are able to let our businesses be guided by his omnipotent will.\nPrioritize Integrity Over Money. Seeking justice over profit is a distinguishing characteristic of a Godly business. When we can do what it right even if it is not the best for the bottom line, we treat people the way Jesus did. Society often paints the picture that in order to succeed in business, we must take shortcuts, cut corners, and misuse people. But the Lord honors truth and justice. He causes us to succeed when love our neighbors.\nThe Lord detests the use of dishonest scales, but he delights in accurate weights. Proverbs 11:1 NLT\n A beautiful reputation is more to be desired than great riches, and to be esteemed by others is more honorable than to own immense investments. Proverbs 22:1 TPT\n Resist the Urge to Strive Trust God's instruction, timing, and provision. We saw earlier how the Lord tells us when to turn and in which direction. He takes care to guide us if we listen to His voice. So when we are faced with how make our business work, the key is to just do what the Lord is telling us. This also means that we mustn't just work all day, trying to force things to go the way we would like. Any one of us can surely put in enough hours, toiling at our craft until something happens. But that is not the way the Lord designed us to live!\nIt really is senseless to work so hard from early morning till late at night, toiling to make a living for fear of not having enough. God can provide for his lovers even while they sleep! Psalm 127:2 TPT\n Instead, He can provide for us even as we rest in His goodness! And we can rest indeed, because He has more than enough to provide for us. After all, He is the creator of the entire universe! Surely He has enough to provide for you!\nYes, God is more than ready to overwhelm you with every form of grace, so that you will have more than enough of everything—every moment and in every way. He will make you overflow with abundance in every good thing you do. II Corinthians 9:8 TPT\n So resist the urge to struggle and strive for yourself. He's must better at providing for us than we are for ourselves.\nSeek to Improve the World Around You Our businesses are not just for us. They allow us to help the people around us who need it. When God moves in the world, He often partners with humans to make change. So if you have an opportunity to help those around you, jump at it! God will reward you.\nIt is better to invite those who never get an invitation. Invite the poor to your banquet, along with the outcast, the handicapped, and the blind—those who could never repay you the favor. Then you will experience a great blessing in this life, and at the resurrection of the godly you will receive a full reward. Luke 14:13-14 TPT  Find Counselors and Advisors No man (or business) is an island. It is important to seek out people of integrity who can guide us. Ask God to bring the people who will help you, so that they can share their experience with you and enrich your business. It's silly to think that only you know what's best. When you have a solid group of advisors, you can attack a problem from many sides!\nPeople lose their way without wise leadership,but a nation succeeds and stands in victory when it has many good counselors to guide it. Proverbs 11:14 TPT\n A fool is in love with his own opinion, but wisdom means being teachable. Proverbs 12:15 TPT\n Follow Godly Wisdom for Your Business As believers and business owners, we've been instructed clearly for success. We must honor God in our businessa by seeking His counselb and the counsel of honest advisorsc while we resist striving in our own powerd. We should prioritize integrity above moneye and commit to improving the world around usf. These instructions apply to more than business, but when applied, they defy worldly wisdom to give us the winning edge.\n            View this post on Instagram                    A post shared by Tweets From Heaven (@tweets.from.heaven)\n    Colossians 3:23, Luke 12:16-21 Proverbs 1:7 Ecclesiastes 4:9-12\u0026nbsp;\u0026#8617;\u0026nbsp;Go Back Matthew 6:31-34\u0026nbsp;\u0026#8617;\u0026nbsp;Go Back Isaiah 1:17 TPT\u0026nbsp;\u0026#8617;\u0026nbsp;Go Back Leviticus 23:22\u0026nbsp;\u0026#8617;\u0026nbsp;Go Back ","permalink":"https://festive-mcclintock-6dbef7.netlify.app/posts/000044_runningagodlybusiness/","tags":["practical","scripture roundup"],"title":"Running a Godly Business"},{"categories":null,"contents":"  Conflict is just a part of life. We will all at one point or another need tools to resolve it. Let's have a look at some Godly principles for handling times when we don't see eye to eye.\nAvoid Strife and Argument Whenever Possible  The Bible tells us that we should try to avoid having the argument in the first place. This is not the same as \"going along to get along\" when a real problem exists. But if there is a way to live peaceably without fighting, we should choose that option.\nThe beginning of strife is like letting out water, so quit before the quarrel breaks out. Proverbs 17:14 ESV\n If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Romans 12:18\tESV\n  Choosing peace over fighting is a mark of wisdom and honor. And when we make it a goal to live in peace with others, we honor The Father.\nA person of honor will put an argument to rest. Only the stupid want to pick a fight. Proverbs 20:3 TPT\n Make it your goal to live a quiet life, minding your own business and working with your hands, just as we instructed you before. 1 Thessalonians 4:11 NLT\n Remember Your Goal: Peace  When tensions rise and arguments break out, it can be easy to forget that we are called to be peacemakers as citizens of God's Kingdom. We are to have a goal to bring everyone into right standing. Instead of making it our goal to \"win\" and argument, we must strive to reconcile with one another.\nMake every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. Hebrews 12:14 NIV\n So then, make it your top priority to live a life of peace with harmony in your relationships, eagerly seeking to strengthen and encourage one another. Romans 14:19 TPT\n  When to goal at the start is peace, we are much less likely to hurt those around us with words that are meant to do more harm than healing. And when we make peace, we are blessed.\n“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. Matthew 5:9 ESV  Listen to the Other Person Instead of Just Talking   If we're always talking, we can never hear what anyone has to say. It is much wiser to listen to--and not just hear--the other person. Because when we just babble on, we may miss something important. If one gives an answer before he hears, it is his folly and shame. Proverbs 18:13 ESV\n  It's also important to know that we may very well be wrong. But how can we find out if we don't honestly listen to the points others are making?\nKnow this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; James 1:19 ESV\n Keep Your Emotions in Check  A couple things about emotions: they are often false, and usually fleeting. If we allow them to steer the ship, we will be in for a bumpy ride. Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. James 1:19-20 ESV\n Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense. Proverbs 19:11 ESV\n  All of us have experienced a time when emotion ran high and we found ourselves saying something we should not have. But if we take charge of emotion and allow cooler heads to prevail, our relationships will definitely benefit.\nChoose Your Words Wisely  Have you experienced a time when it wasn't what you said, but how you said it that sparked conflict? Or perhaps a time with just one misplaced word was the trigger? In life, we must be aware not only of the things we say, but how the way we choose to say them.\nA soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. Proverbs 15:1 ESV\n  So when you talk to people, make sure you choose gentleness in your speech and be mindful of who you're talking to and how they like to be talked to.\nLet your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone. Colossians 4:6 NIV\n  A little consideration goes a long way.\nConflict Resolution Should Be a Priority in Your Relationships  God made us to be social, to need each other. And we can't really hold on to relationships where conflict cannot be resolved in a healthy way. This is just one reason we have to give priority to resolving conflict.  The Bible tells us that there are times when we need to stop what we're doing and make an effort to reconcile with each other. So then, if you are presenting a gift before the altar in the temple and suddenly you remember a quarrel you have with a fellow believer, leave your gift there in front of the altar and go at once to apologize with the one who is offended. Then, after you have reconciled, come to the altar and present your gift. Matthew 5:23-24 TPT\n  And we are also told that we should try to resolve anger quickly.\nBe angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, Ephesians 4:26 ESV\n Know that the Consequences of Unresolved Conflict Are Dire  All of this is resolving and understanding is with the goal of preventing bitterness and hatred in our relationships.\nWatch over each other to make sure that no one misses the revelation of God’s grace. And make sure no one lives with a root of bitterness sprouting within them which will only cause trouble and poison the hearts of many. Hebrews 12:15 TPT\n  And when we let bitterness take root in our relationships, it can ultimately be used by our true enemy: the devil. Don’t let the sun go down while you are still angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil. Ephesians 4:26-27 TPT\n  Conflict may be a part of life, but we needn't resolve it just any old way. We have clear instruction that will give us victory even over hurt feelings and heightened emotions.

Isaiah 59:19b KJV\n But What Does \"Standard\" Mean Here? The word \"standard\" originates from Middle English, and refers to a flag raised on a pole as a rallying point in battle. It is an object that soldiers can look for to find where allies are. When we use the phrase \"raise a standard\" we are talking about rallying for a fight!\n We find a story of how powerful the standard of God can be in Exodus. The Isrealites are fighting with a nearby nation. During the battle, and Moses raises the staff the Lord gave him over his head.  As long as he held it high, the Isrealites were winning. But when the standard fell, so did the Israelites. Eventually, others helped Moses hold the staff high through the night, and Israel secured the victory.

It's a great way to discover new songs to sing to the Lord.\nFocus on God's Presence When we live our lives within the shadow of God Most High, our secret hiding place, we will always be shielded from harm.

Is this thought designed to help me win? Or is telling me to give up? Is this making me want to try again after I've fallen? Or is it making me want to wallow in guilt and regret? Does this thought give me renewed zeal? Or is it sapping me dry? Is this changing my appetites? Or is it telling me I'll always struggle with this? Does it make me want to stand up or sit down in the face of injustice? Does this view my flaws through the filter of Christ's blood or through the lens of the enemy? Does it make me want to run to God or flee from His presence?  Remember: condemnation leaves you trapped in a cycle of negativity. Conviction stops the cycle and gives you a new path. If the sorrow you feel is just making you feel terrible, and not producing any improvements in you, it is not of God.\nMay God raise your discernment so that you are never trapped in condemnation again, for there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ.a\n            View this post on Instagram                    A post shared by Tweets From Heaven (@tweets.from.heaven)\n   Romans 8:1\u0026nbsp;\u0026#8617;\u0026nbsp;Go Back ","permalink":"https://festive-mcclintock-6dbef7.netlify.app/posts/000034_condemnationvsconviction_6/","tags":["no condemnation","practical","scripture breakdown","series summary"],"title":"Spotting Condemnation Posing as Conviction: Finale"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Yesterday, we saw how conviction gives us appetites for justice while condemnation ultimately pulls us to do wrong.

Condemnation is the enemy's view of you. The enemy calls us irredeemable and worthless. He highlights our mistakes as evidence in the hope that we give in and agree with him.\nConviction drives you to God. Conviction exposes a flaw in order to drive us to the only one who can help us overcome it. We run toward God, seeking the changes that He Himself makes to our hearts.\nCondemnation drives you away from God. Condemnation exposes a shortcoming in order to drive us away from the very one helping us. We run away from God, trying to heal ourselves for fear of the wrath we've been told will surely come.

It whispers to you that you are inherently terrible and can only do what is wrong. It magnifies shortcomings as \"proof\" of the lie. Conviction gives us a hunger for justice. When we've been convicted of the ways we've been unjust, it changes our tolerance for injustice. It makes us want to correct unfairness and speak up against evil.\nCondemnation twists the meaning of justice.

You experienced godly sorrow, and as God intended, it brought about gain for you, not loss, so that no harm has been done by us.

Can’t you see the good fruit that has come, as God intended, because of your remorse over sin? Now you are eager to do what is right! Look at the indignation you experienced over what happened and how alarmed you became. What holy longing it awakened, what passion for God, and how ready you were to bring justice to the offender. Your response has proved that you are free of blame in this matter.

The Bible tells us that Israel had just lost a war to Babylon and that many people of the noble families in Israel had been taken away to serve in the palace there. b Let's read starting at the third verse: 3\u0026nbsp;Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief of staff, to bring to the palace some of the young men of Judah’s royal family and other noble families, who had been brought to Babylon as captives. 4\u0026nbsp;“Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. “Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon. Daniel 1:3-4 NLT\n So here we see a specific order to take the high-status members of Israelite society and put them in a lowered position. We'll meet a few of these high-status Israelites in the next verses. 6\u0026nbsp;Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were four of the young men chosen, all from the tribe of Judah.7\u0026nbsp;The chief of staff renamed them with these Babylonian names: Daniel was called Belteshazzar. Hananiah was called Shadrach. Mishael was called Meshach. Azariah was called Abednego. Daniel 1:6-7 NLT\n Here we see those familiar names: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. But what we're seeing here is that these young men's names have been changed. So let's take a look at what these Hebrew names meant, as well as what the Babylonian names meant. Daniel translates to \"God is my judge.\" Hananiah translates to \"Jehovah is gracious.\" Mishael translates to \"Who is what God is?\" Azariah translates to \"Yahweh has helped.\" Belteshazzar translates to \"May Bel protect his life.\" Shadrach translates to \"Servant of Aku.\" Meshach translates to \"Who is what Aku is?\" Abednego translates to \"Command of Nego.\" Now we see what's really happening with this name-change. Not only are these young men being brought very far from home, but they are made servants in the Babylonian palace and given new names that exalt false gods. This is made worse because we know that people in ancient Israel and Babylon people would have been very aware of name meanings. They would have put a great deal of thought into naming a person. I believe this was a strategic attempt to take away their Jewish identities and give them Babylonian lives. ## How Does this Apply to Me? Each and every one of us has been given a call by God. He has given us a name that speaks to our purpose, telling us who we are and who we are to be. But there are forces around us that would like that name changed. Perhaps it's the culture around us, the people around us, or even the fear within us--whatever the reason, you may find who you are under attack. But there is good news: the only name we need pay attention to is the name given to us by the Father. When He formed us in the womb, He knew well what He had planned for us. He has destined each of us for something, and no one can take that destiny away. So maybe God has called you a teacher, but those around you say that you aren't fit to teach. Maybe He has called you to go into your community help the people around you, but you are discouraged because your efforts seem to make little difference. Perhaps He's called you to a specific location, but your family thinks it would be foolish to go there. I don't know what your call is, but I bet you do. Today is the day to start answering to your God-given name! Let's Pray Father, thank You for the identity You have given us. You call us children of the Most High God. You say that we are Your own. And because You are our Father, we have access to Your throne of grace. We know You have called us for a purpose. Give us endurance to keep answering to the name You have given us. And when we are unsure of that call, make Your voice clear in our ears. Open our ears, hearts, and minds to hear what You are speaking to us. Give us your strength that propels us from our weakness. And as we walk in Your purpose, let everyone everywhere know that we are Yours. Amen.
